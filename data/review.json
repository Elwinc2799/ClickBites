I hate hearing that kind of stuff because they are located right near several large businesses that could be regular customers.\n\nThe Nook is, well a nook in the shopping center. They have a small menu and serve breakfast all day, which is a nice treat, but today I was in the mood for lunch so I ordered a turkey club on two slices of bread, and my friend had a garden salad. My sandwich was good, with well toasted bread, crispy bacon, crunchy lettuce, fresh tomato, and impressively, house roasted, thick cut turkey breast. It was served with crispy fries and a garnish of parsley a black olive, and a few shavings of carrot, which is about what you'd expect at a diner! \n\nThe garden salad was well, garden variety. Iceberg lettuce, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots.

Order them (in whatever seasonal flavor variation they offer).  They arrive as perfectly crispy, delicate, sugar-salted bites of dough.\n\nTwo - the hot dog alone is worth a visit.  It used to be a full-sized sandwich when they first opened.  Now you have to order 2 or 3 \"mini-hot dogs\" but the flavors are the same - crisp bun, horseradish mustard and jalapeno jam - none of which overpower the dog itself.  The pretentious ingredients somehow combine to make it taste like the best backyard grill-dog you've ever had.\n\nYou are right to laugh at the notion of going to the Ritz for a hot dog...but, it does not change the fact that we do, again and again.  Order the fries as well - they never disappoint.\nThe other sliders and lobster-roll minis are great too; the hot dog just surprises, perhaps because one rarely raves about a hot dog.\n\nThe menu is sparse and drinks are some of the priciest in Philadelphia.  However, the bartenders are trained and know how to make a vesper if you ask for it, which in our experience is a rare plus.","date":"2011-03-29 18:07:25","vector":[0.1459,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

There are also volunteer opportunities. Donations are currently accepted on GoFundMe for prepaying in advance or you could pay in person as well (no change for cash currently).\n\nWith COVID, they've gone with outdoor seating on the lawn, dine-in your car, or drive-through, pick-up, and go. The parking lot is pretty easy to see as you're driving to the location. You'll see all the volunteers outside with a shade covering. They will direct you to where to park and then will walk up to get your order and deliver the food.\n\nTheir meals are pretty tasty with the different volunteer chefs. In all the meals I've gotten, they usually come with an appetizer, main entree, dessert, and drink. I haven't been disappointed with any dinners yet.

Origin stories of this lunar leporid generally involve a theme of community, respect, and self-sacrifice. These allegorical traditions are the inspiration behind a once-a-month dinner served at the Moon Rabbit Cafe, a pay-what-you-can community effort staffed by volunteers at the Reno Buddhist Center (every third Saturday, 4pm-8pm).\n\nDining is done family style, with long tables of about 12 seats each and a total capacity of 80. We waited for roughly 30 minutes to be seated, and the staff tell me they served a record crowd of over 200 that evening. The aromas coming from the dining room were so enticing we didn't mind a bit on the wait, and the volunteer staff did a bang-up job keeping things friendly and feeling unrushed, all while moving folks through at a decent pace.\n\nEach month a different theme is chosen, often with a guest chef creating the menu. April's theme was \"Ooh La La Paris in the Spring\", featuring some classic French dishes, each with a little twist showcasing the chef's creativity. First course was a canap\u00e9 plate of crostini with toasted gruyere, a jam of caramelized onion and rosemary, garnished with fresh chives and chive blossoms. The appearance and flavor was akin to a deconstructed French onion soup, with a nice touch of garden freshness.\n\nThere were two entr\u00e9es to choose from--one vegan, one not--both served with an arugula salad dressed in lemon and fennel seed vinaigrette. By itself the salad was a star on the plate, the peppery flavor of arugula pairing perfectly with the seasoned, slightly tart dressing. Layered ratatouille filled the vegan role, with green zucchini, yellow squash, and roma tomatoes. A thick, pureed sauce made from the vegetable ends, eggplant, red bell pepper, onion, lemon, rosemary, and oil perfectly bound it all together. Definitely one of the most flavorful squash-based dishes I've been served.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, the chef's take on coq au vin started with chicken thighs marinated in pinot noir, seared in bacon fat, then braised in a blend of wine and housemade veggie stock. Combined with roasted red potatoes and turnips--and carrots sauteed in butter and cardamom--the resulting flavor profile was very well developed, subtle, and truly delicious.\n\nBeverages included ice water, tea, coffee, and a spritzer that appeared to be a blend of concord grape juice and seltzer water. The spritzer didn't really work for me--reminding me of Kiddie Coolers my parents used to order for us tykes--but the coffee was quite good, very robust and a perfect pairing with dessert. Provided by a local bakery, dessert was a delicate little lemon and raspberry tartlet served a la mode. It featured a nice balance of tart and sweet, with a single whole raspberry right in the center. A perfect end to a great meal.\n\nI found the pay-what-you-can concept a refreshing idea, allowing folks from all walks of life to enjoy a great meal together. Both while waiting to be seated and during the meal, it was hard not to connect and chat with perfect strangers enjoying the meal and the community vibe together. The next dinner is on May 21st, although the theme and chef are yet to be announced. The chef who prepared our delicious meal turns out to be a semi-amateur with a passion for cooking, and Moon Rabbit Cafe is seeking new chefs to create future dinners If you are or know someone with a similar drive to share your talents for a great cause, contact Shelly or Connie at 775-525-1182 or moonrabbit@renobuddhistcenter.org.","date":"2016-05-15 22:55:16","vector":[0.1199125,0.0,-0.05135,0.0,0.0]}

The breakfasts were absolutely phenomenal - another example of how Richard goes out of his way to accommodate your preferences and requests.  Another example: I had a group of 4 staying in the Chardonnay Room; 2 guests were driving into town early while my flight got in super late. Richard was attentive and communicative in arranging for them to check in ahead of time so that the place would be ready for us the moment we got there late at night.  \n\nAs for the House itself, it is a great historic building with lots of nice decor, both inside and out, and the rooms themselves are perfectly sized with comfortable beds and everything else you'll need.  And though I didn't get a chance to use it, the pool and spa area is great too.  Importantly, if you prefer your quiet when sleeping, this place is perfect as it is in a quieter location of town.

Also, $8.99 for a 6 inch roast beef po-boy is definitely not cheap - especially given that they're not as generous on the fillings as other places.  The roast beef po-boy was pretty good and the red beans & rice were better with the addition of smoked sausage, plus the doughnuts looked great although we didn't try any.  If you're in the neighborhood definitely stop into this homey little corner shop by but if you're far away I can't imagine it's worth the time or cost to drive or take a cab just for a po-boy here (and it's unfortunately not near the streetcar).  Everybody has a different opinion and I do like this place, but I prefer the po-boys at Mahoney's, Parkway Bakery, and Guy's myself - better bread, better flavor, and similar pricing for a 6\" sandwich but you get more stuff at the other places so a 6\" sandwich fills you up and you don't need to pay for a larger size.","date":"2011-02-14 21:24:56","vector":[0.22435,0.0,0.0,0.1901,0.064]}

I came in with my parents expecting a classy restaurant \/ Hookah bar and I felt like I was in a Persian Hooters joint. There were a bunch of flat screen TVs everywhere showing movies on TBS. It only made me feel more like I was in a cheap bar. If people come to a classy restaurant, the atmosphere, people, and more importantly food should be the main theme of the experience. Not the Dark Knight in the background.   \n\nWe ordered appetizers, and they absolutely sucked. The hummus tasted like it was old and from a can. The Yogurt dip was bland. The bread was obviously not made in house and was ordered as you could taste the enriched white flower. We came in a large group 10+ and we were the ONLY people in the restaurant at the time and our waitress could even get the drinks to the right people. I ordered a water and she placed it in front of someone else. I ordered the Barg Kabob (Steak-Filet Kabob) and the person next to me who I came with ordered the Lamb Kabob. Let me remind you that we are the ONLY people in the restaurant and there are a good 3-4 waiters\/waitresses in the restaurant and they still managed to switch my plate with the person sitting next to me. They looked exactly the same and I noticed that I was eating lamb after a good 3-4 bites in. I noticed that it was lamb after so long because it was OVERCOOKED. It had no taste. Once the person next to me switched plates my Barg Kabob was ALSO OVERCOOKED.\n\nTowards the end of the night a large young crowd came to the restaurant and they were all smoking Hookah in the restaurant area. Not in the designated smoking areas off to the sides of the restaurant. Then they had a musical performer come in. I was actually excited because I thought it was a Persian restaurant so they would play some live Persian music. To my surprise they had a country music singer come in and play the guitar. Not a problem, but a little weird since we are in a PERSIAN restaurant.\n\nThe singer started singing, and the crowd wasn't really giving the man much love. I started clapping for the guy since he had the balls to come into a middle eastern restaurant and sing a few country songs. However I stopped clapping when he started asking if there were any Marines in the restaurant that had got back from Iraq or Afghanistan and started making passive-aggressive racist remarks. \n\nWe ordered dessert and holy crap it sucked more than the entrees. The baklava cake was obviously frozen before it came out as I basically had to use everything short of a plasma torch to cut it. The cake they also brought is was obviously not made in house and sucked. \n\nThe only thing i enjoyed about this restaurant was the tea. It was decent. Everything else from start to finish seemed like a child was running it. I really wanted to like this place, truly. I am Persian and know what really good Persian food is and this place gives Persian food a bad image. \n\nIf you want decent Persian food in Nashville go to House of Kabob on Nolensville Rd. If you want the BEST Persian food in the world go to Rumi's in Atlanta, GA.","date":"2012-07-29 00:10:58","vector":[0.0994916667,0.0,0.0,0.2715857143,0.2553]}

From the neon rabbit that glows above Prospect Street to the sumptuous couches and little black caf\u00e9 tables, this newcomer exudes a lot of class. However, I'm taking a small leap of faith by giving the White Rabbit 4 stars. I love the concept, but I was not bowled over the show I saw, which was called \"The Muncie Brothers' House of Fun.\" \n\nKudos to the dancers in this vaguely Halloween-themed act--they were talented, sexy and delightfully costumed. They looked like Tim Burton might have styled them himself--think Hot Topic, all grown up. What did not impress me were the misogynistic overtones of the banter offered by the show's Emcee, a sort of hillbilly clown with a Tom Waits growl. His repeated efforts to control the dancers (\"bitches\") and his gruff, sailor-mouthed denigrations of his \"brother\" and co-host, a mute clown--a character who did hold some appeal, if only by comparison--were pretty retrograde. I understand that the joke was on him because he couldn't, in the end, control any of them and wound up in a straight jacket himself, but the narrative left me shaking my head. \n\nI think it didn't help that the night before I attended a screening of the film \"Cabaret,\" which highlights acts that are as much a commentary on politics, social norms and gender roles as they are entertaining and titillating. I think I expected something a little more high-minded from a show at White Rabbit. I think Indianapolis is ready for it.","date":"2010-10-07 12:31:48","vector":[0.1186,0.0,0.1702,0.142975,0.0]}

We live in a the neighborhood so a few months ago we tried to have dinner at L'Oca without a reservation.  They said there was a 30 or 40 minute wait and since there was absolutely no where to wait for our table, other than outside in the cold, we decided to leave our cell phone number with the waiter (because there is no hostess) and go to the bar down the street to wait for our table.  They never called and we didn't eat dinner there that night.\n\n2.  Then I saw a Philly Dealyo offering a $40 coupon for the cost of $20 at L'Oca - again since we live in the neighborhood I figured we would give them another try, perhaps it was just an \"off\" night the previous time we tried to eat there.  WRONG.  On Wednesday I made a reservation for 8 pm on Friday night.  We get there and our table is not ready.  They made us wait outside for 10 minutes before I went inside and asked if our table was ready - it was, the waiter just never came and told us - again the problem with not having a hostess.  So we go and sit down and the waiter reaches over us to open our bottle of wine and and the smell of his body odor overwhelms us. Fighting off the gag reflex we order a salad and an appetizer with him.  A few minutes later a DIFFERENT waiter comes over and takes our dinner order. We chose the duck breast and the ribeye.  We drink a glass of wine and the waiter brings out dinner  - we never got out appetizers.  On top of that he brings just my dinner, not my boyfriends. I had the $26 duck and it was so tough I needed a steak knife. It lacked flavor and was a huge disappointment.  I sawed through it with my butter knife because I was starving by this point.  My boyfriend had the $32 ribeye and he said it tasted like a $6 piece of meat off the grill.  No flavor at all.  \n\nThe table next to us had 8 people.  They were sat a few minutes after we were.  We were finished with our dinner before their waiter ever came to take their order. I overheard the man at the head of the table ask if they could have a waiter take their order.  We started talking to them about how bad the place was and told them not to order the duck or the ribeye.  20 minutes later  as we were leaving that table had 2 of the 8 dinners on the table just sitting there getting cold as they waited for their guests dinners to arrive.  Overall this place needs a lot of help.\n\nWays to redeem themselves - hire a manager, appoint a head waiter or hostess to take care of people when they arrive, and when they screw up they should offer something to make their customer feel better.","date":"2011-05-14 14:14:14","vector":[-0.039,0.0566090909,0.07224,-0.0097166667,0.43245]}

The chicken was tasty I'll have to admit that but I was thoroughly unimpressed.","date":"2018-06-20 04:40:04","vector":[-0.0857166667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I'm partial to the creamy garlic, however I have yet to have one that I actually disliked.\nI digress.. the real reason for the review on this particular PDQ is because it is 1 of the 3 in the area that offer wings now!

While pretty good - good size, unique\/different sauces available, cooked pretty crispy - I cannot say this is my favorite wing place... however! I do recommend trying, because I can easily see it being someones favorite (or multiple peoples favorite). They were good - don't get me wrong. Just not a favorite.\nHave I already gone back to another PDQ just to eat?

I follow the Instagram for its location and hours. Most of the time it is available at the corner of 7 and McKean from 3-9.\n\nI got there at 3 on a drizzly afternoon. There were already a couple of people waiting for their order. Besides the birria tacos, they have guacamole and chips. Very friendly and welcoming. My order was ready probably in 10 minutes. Much faster than the other popular birria tacos food truck several blocks away.\n\nThe tacos have two layers of crispy tortilla with caramelized melted cheese adding umami to the tacos. It automatically comes with cheese so if you don't want cheese I recommend that you tell them when you place the order. The cheese are evenly distributed and melts on  tortilla perfectly, not too much to create a glob of cheese. The tacos are filled with good amount of tender beef with finely chopped onions. The tortilla is completely soaking the flavor of the consomm\u00e9 already drizzled on it during the cooking process. The moment of truth: the consomm\u00e9 flavor. It's amazing, balanced flavor with a subtle heat, very refreshing, and don't forget to squirt the lime. I keep on dunking the tacos in it. If you like more heat to your tacos, they have it covered by providing creamy chipotle sauce in the bag. There's also some shredded beef in the consomm\u00e9. Not too greasy, I don't want to waste any of it. Maybe make a ramen with the leftover consomm\u00e9. I saw an Instagram post of ramen with birria consomm\u00e9.\n\nGuacamole is fresh with enough heat from the chopped jalape\u00f1o with chopped tomato and red onion. It comes in a paper coffee cup with a lid.\n\nWhat I like about this truck is the consomm\u00e9 and the guacamole are not in a styrofoam cup. The tacos and the chips are in styrofoam container. I hope they can change it to more environmentally friendly container.","date":"2021-01-03 22:13:46","vector":[0.0969435897,0.0,0.00378,0.0,0.0]}

Get  2x whatever you think you'll probably want to eat. You're Welcome.\n\n\nLong form:\n\nIf you're an average taco consumer, you know there are two kinds. There are the kind you've seen at TGI Fridays and Chilis and, perhaps, Taco Bell and you know all these suck and deserve a different name. The second type is usually found at a taco truck or a taqueria, which isn't authentic unless there are colorful, paper, birthday party-esque decorations, and some type of mariachi-esque sounding music in the background. These tacos are awesome, abundant in Philly, and easily searchable.\n\nIf you've not come across quality versions of these, here are ways to ensure you're getting the real deal:\n\nif they come wrapped in two (2) corn tortillas, that's a good sign\n\nif they are small enough that you could eat at least 4, that's a good sign\n\nif they come garnished with ONLY cilantro, onion, and perhaps little radishes, that's a good sign\n\nif you're offered a mild green salsa and an asshole burning red salsa, that's a good sign\n\nif you're speaking into a truck, that's a good sign\n\nif anything \"hip\" is offered, thai curry, soy protein, korean gojujang, beyond meat, cauliflower, etc. GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!\n\nif nobody appears to be Mexican at all, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!\n\nif you're offered ketchup at any time in the meal, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!\n\nAll of this said, there are a few other types of tacos worth trying before you die. Birria tacos are on that list, and, somewhat recently, easily accessible in Philadelphia!!  These have been around forever at South Philly Barbacoa and she is the OG. You MUST check them out if you have not already.\n\nBirria, which usually translates to \"goat\" in English, refers to shredded and braised meat (typically beef, at least in my Philly taco experience). These tacos are also often fried (tortilla and all) in the birria meat's oil, so the resulting taco is crispy, flavorful (even the tortilla itself), and insanely delicious. Anyone who's gotten drunk and made the regrettable decision of visiting a taco bell knows a crunchy taco just crumbles (while tasing like old cardboard) turning a shitty taco into a taco salad. This is NOT the case with these tacos- they crunch in all the right ways, leaving the consumer satisfied, majestified, and enthralled.\n\nAs if this all weren't enough, each order of birria tacos also comes with a dipping cup of the braising broth (consome) to dip the tacos! And... (yes, there's more!)... the tacos come w\/ melted cheese, fiery asshole burning salsa, and a bunch of napkins!\n\nI am a taco expert, but not a tech expert, so I was surprised to initially find these tacos on Instagram. My foody wife informed me that IG is now a place to find food- I didn't know that before!\n\nAnyway, we live on 7th and South and decided to walk to Burrito Feliz for these Birria tacos. If it's not evident by my 3000 word post, the tacos were phenomenal and we will be back! They were phenomenally better than Barbacoa's (sorry barbacoa). On the walk down, we passed two other trucks (one which had a 2 hour-ish line) and at least two restaurants offering birria. I'm sure those are worth a taste as well, but I cannot imagine them being any better than Burrito Feliz. \n\nBTW- we got the churros (great but not slap ya mama great, and the shrimp tacos (good, but we should have just gotten more birria instead!!!).","date":"2021-02-08 16:37:10","vector":[0.050958,0.0,0.0,-0.0910666667,0.1238666667]}

For the unfamiliar, birria is meat (typically goat, lamb, or beef), slow-cooked with classic spices and seasoning, including chilis, garlic, bay leaves, and cumin. Quesabirria is a modern adaptation of birria, consisting of tacos featuring a layer of crisp, melted chees, served beside a cup of consomme for dipping. \n\nSome friends and I recently had the opportunity to enjoy birria from Burrito Feliz's truck at Love City Brewing (aside -- LCB has a stellar HH deal: $4 for any brew on draught). The mint-green truck was unmistakable, featuring Mexico-inspired sketches and a minifridge below the ordering window. Although Burrito Feliz has multiple protein options (including vegetarian options), my eyes and heart immediately locked onto the Birria Tacos. We ordered, then scanned the Venmo code to beside the window. Early on this weeknight, there were only a handful of folks ahead of us, translating to just a few minutes wait.\n\nBurrito Feliz's rendition of quesabirria utilized two tortillas per taco, fried crispy with a layer of cheese between. Each taco packed a generous quantity of beef, garnished with onion, cilantro, and a few lime slices. The heft tacos were flavorful alone but reached a whole new level with the consomme. This broth packed a surprising punch, hosting a rich variety of flavors. Even the chipotle dipping sauce on the side was a star, featuring smokey notes and a low, lingering spice. My only critique on the food was that the birria itself was slightly tough and dry -- quickly overcome with a hearty dunk into the consomme. Most of us thoroughly enjoyed our birria entrees, but my plant-based friend also commended Burrito Feliz' tofu chorizo tacos (I tried a bite, and can confirm they were solid).\n\nAt $14 for 3 tacos and consomme, Burrito Feliz may ring on the expensive side for food truck fare (potentially due to pandemic-related food shortages?). Nonetheless, this limitation is decidedly outweighed by the hefty portions, robust flavors, and notably quick queue. I strongly anticipate craving birria again soon, and when it does, this mobile taquer\u00eda will be on my shortlist","date":"2022-01-07 19:59:45","vector":[0.056872093,0.0,0.1417666667,0.0,0.6369]}

There was also a hockey game  and a big NFL game going on at the same time...but there's TV's everywhere, so everyone can find a spot to watch their game of preference.\n\nEvery time I've been here, the owner of the bar sits in a rolling office chair at a round poker table near the corner of the main bar area. And he usually has several of his closest buddies with him where they just relax and hangout out at the round table the whole night. That's not exactly my idea of a fun tradition, but it does give the bar a nice atmosphere and they seem to have a good time. \n\nAnyways, midway thru my game, some crazy stranger walks into the bar and tries to change the TV that my game is on!

The buffet is $5.95 plus tax and a drink per person. We just drank water. So our total was under $13. \nThe buffet started out with a salad bar with many options. Next was plain pasta and you could put marinara or alfredo sauce. I skipped that section. On to the pizza... They had about 10 different ones to choose from.

The service gets 3 (on the night we visited - a Wed). \n\nA group of friends met here for dinner on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant was not overly crowded. My parents had always loved the location in Tubac so I wanted to try it. \n\nI immediately loved the look of the place. It has lovely decor and ambiance! It is a bit small and quaint, but has an elegance while remaining cozy. A perfect combo. Lighting is adequate (you don't need to use a phone-light to read the menu). \n\nWe all enjoyed our food very much! Great cheese crisp appetizer! The chips and salsa served for a table of 5 should have been doubled and one placed at each end. I had the Miso Cod. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. Others had the house special shrimp, molcajote (sp?) of tongue (very spicy, but very tasty), the chicken mole, which was also incredibly well done. I don't recall what the 5th person in our group ordered. But, all of our food was served piping hot, fresh tasting, and delicious. \n\nOur only complaints were service. It was a bit 'off' - disjointed, confused, things in wrong order, took forever to get drinks and refills. Our server 'disappeared' a lot, causing us to have to flag other staff down who were not assigned to us. It was mildly annoying. Everyone can have an off day, so we chalked it up to that. Two in our party said the service issue, along with cost was not worth a return trip. I usually give a place at least 2-3 tries if the food is excellent; and, it was. I also did not find it overly expensive; portions are quite decent. Hopefully the service that day was a fluke. \n\nHowever, to be fair, while the service was a bit slow\/disorganized, everyone we interacted with was incredibly professional and very friendly. \n\nBest of luck to this well established restaurant in its new location! I hope it will be successful. \n\nTIPS\/NOTES: There is no parking lot on site, but plenty of parking nearby\/easy walk. It has an open kitchen, so if you want a more quiet evening ask to sit near the front\/middle of the restaurant.","date":"2016-12-06 00:04:34","vector":[0.28277,-0.2094,0.0332,0.1353666667,0.6249]}

Unfortunately, the product offered does not match the price tag. I ordered the poblano mole and a bacanora a\u00f1ejo, which was a relatively solid choice. The white chicken was cooked well, juicy, and bathed in a modestly complex mole. The wild rice and beans on the side were weak; the rice was extremely bland, and the beans seemed to be refried and from a can. Others at our table ordered grilled cabrilla (white fish) on a bed of pineapple and the Sosa style shrimp. The fish was cooked well and decently seasoned but the dish overall was too simple and fell flat. The shrimp dish consisted of little more than five or six shrimp tails in sauce, leaving that guest hungry. For plates that run upwards of $20, we expected more. \n\nService was hit and miss. The hostesses seated us quickly, as we had a reservation, but there was confusion as to who was assigned to be our server. Our first server was a young man who ambled around the restaurant, distracted by the NBA playoff game on TV. After fifteen to twenty minutes of inattention, a woman named Fernanda took over and did extremely well. She was attentive (but not overbearing) and very sweet. \n\nThe visual ambiance, as you've likely heard by now, is beautiful with a very modern and ornate ceiling decoration. The seating is a combination of standard tables along with a few communal benches. The night we dined there, a very talented musical duo was playing cumbia and other Latin styles with guitar, vocals, and percussion. They sounded great, but they were amplified by a speaker which was completely unnecessary and nearly drowned out our own voices. I observed other parties asking for tables away from the band, as they were that loud.\n\nMy final verdict is that this location of Elvira's has potential, but needs to tune a few aspects of their experience in order to be successful. Either the food needs to \"wow\" us and earn its price tag, or the prices need to drop by around 30%. The staff, while running more smoothly than at the opening, still has a way to go. The musicians need to be made aware of their volume level in order to maintain an enjoyable and comfortable atmosphere for the guests.\n\nUnless something changes, I recommend visiting Cafe Poca Cosa when you crave upscale Mexican cuisine. They simply do it better.","date":"2016-06-14 04:40:59","vector":[0.0181352941,0.0,-0.12264,0.0816777778,0.0]}

Same delicious taste we always get... we tried a new flavor (Louisiana rub) so yum! This location is bigger than I'm used to, plenty of seating! So yep, perfect way to end my long day!","date":"2018-02-10 19:07:37","vector":[0.1906333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

This has to be the worst and the most overpriced seafood in all of Indianapolis.  The place was empty but the service was slow and unpleasant.  I started with an order of the king crab legs which looked diseased and had a funny smell which I could not finish.  My wife had the fish platter which was dripping with grease and she could not finish.  We left $75 dollars lighter and still hungry so we stopped at White castles...I give Whities 5 stars for saving the day.","date":"2013-05-14 03:16:16","vector":[-0.156225,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0]}

Visited on a Saturday around 3pm.  Greeted promptly by hostess, who wasn't very friendly, but that's okay.  Restaurant smelled like the ocean, which is a good sign for a place that serves seafood.\n\nGreeted promptly by server and drinks brought quickly.  She even made me a virgin cherry limeade in a take-home mason jar glass (nice, but not worth the $1.99 - I'll get over it).  We started with 12 boiled, Old Bay seasoned shrimp appetizer.  Chilled and tasty if not a little overcooked.  Felt rushed as meals came out before we were even through the appetizer.  Hubby ordered classic steampot with Sunset Grilled seasoning and I had the steampot with the lobster and crab.  Arrived promptly and hot.  Hubby not wild about the seasoning.  My lobster was way overcooked; the body meat was rubbery and only the claw meat had the right texture.  Potatoes good.  Corn, again, overcooked.  Snow crab was good.  Hubby ordered additional cluster of snow crab ($7.49), which server forgot and I had to remind her.  Dungeness crab okay.  Snow crab tasted the best.  Server was good, promptly refilled our drinks and brought me lemon when I asked for it (anything to make the lobster less rubbery!)\n\nWith tip, bill was $99 for both of us (no alcohol or dessert).  This was our third visit to a Joe's and it will be the last.  It costs me way less to buy crab in the seafood dept. of our local Kroger and make it at home.  Definitely not worth the money.  I haven't had lobster in about 5 years and I was disappointed for sure.","date":"2012-06-04 13:07:33","vector":[0.02202,0.0,0.0,0.3612,0.0]}

The patio is beautiful if it's nice out, but the banquettes along the wall in between the bar and the terrace look like a great spot if you wanted a quieter, more romantic dinner. Definitely a great date night option or a place to take a prospective business client.","date":"2017-11-07 02:29:46","vector":[0.3121333333,0.0,0.4939,0.2282142857,0.0]}

While I had not heard of a lot of this cuisine, he was very familiar with the menu items after having lived near the Bay Area for years.\n\nWe started with the Dim Sum Pork and Shrimp Siu Mai served with Ginger Soy Dipping Sauce ($10). These were great! They were savory and every bite was packed with flavor. Definitely a bit of a learning curve as they are slippery to grab with chopsticks. I found them sticky and fun to eat. I would absolutely recommend these.\n\nWe ordered the Bao Buns with Boneless Braised Short Rib made of Korean Spiced meat, Cucumber, and Daikon Radish Slaw ($18). I found the buns themselves to be puffy and almost sweet. The flavor was out of this world good! The meat had big umami flavor and the slaw I could've eaten on the side. It was so, so good. The vinegar flavor did not overwhelm the slaw and I prefer it that way. My coworker found the flavor to be almost too savory per his experience. \n\nWe each also ordered Ramen. (Can you tell we came HUNGRY?) My coworker ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen. His ramen was comprised of Double Pork Broth, Pork Belly, Red Miso, Szechuan Pepper Bomb, Baby Bok Choy, Bamboo Shoots, Scallions, Chili Threads, Nori, Serrano Peppers, and a Marinated Soft Boiled Egg. He found his ramen to be okay. He only got  1\/2 of the marinated soft boiled egg and mentioned the spiciness he'd been looking for wasn't there. He's had a lot of Bay Area Ramen and found this good but not as good as it gets.\n\nI ordered the Wor Wonton Soup, which had Chicken Broth, Pork Wontons, Chicken, Shrimp, Mushrooms, Baby Bok Choy, Water Chestnuts, and Scallions. Mine was good. I really liked the pork wontons, but found them a little of the big side to handle. It was overall, what I'd expected. I wouldn't say best ramen I've had but I wouldn't say it was bad by any means.\n\nOverall, I liked Red Bloom. I do not see myself going there very often though. I don't frequent casinos often for starters.

We were all highly disappointed with the food. The presentation was lovely and it all looked very appetizing, but there was absolutely no flavor to the dishes. The best things we ate were the egg rolls and the chicken wings. The other dishes were so bland and lacked any flavor. I hate to say it, but I felt the Chinese dishes in the buffet are much better.

This restaurant is new, so I anticipate they'll make some adjustments over time to get their stars up. I would return. \n\nTo start, we ordered the shishito peppers, which are standard fare at any modern Asian restaurant, but the seasonings used at Red Bloom made something standard stand out. I would order this again. \n\nNext up: the pork belly bao buns. Definitely do yourself a favor and order these! The umami factor is not missed with this adventure of an appetizer. One in our party actually ordered them as her main.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered two types of ramen, the pork belly and spicy miso. My ramen was not nearly as hot as it should have been, and the ramen noodles had been cooked too long. With ramen, you always serve the noodles al dente and allow the guest to determine the texture they want their noodles to be by serving it in the scalding hot liquid that the noodles sit and continue to cook in. Instead, that decision was made for me. Haru on Longley gets this concept right consistently, and having lived in Japan for two years, I appreciate their attention to authenticity.\n\nThe texture of all the ingredients in the bowl were also too similar, so this was an overall huge miss for me. The presentation was lazy for a dish you can enjoy for less at Haru. Take a look at my ramen from there and ask yourself which one is worth $18.\n\nThe spicy miso, which comes with a warning of two chiles on the menu, is not spicy -- not even a little bit.\n\nThe friendliness and warmth of our server, Angelo, was very inviting.\n\nAlthough nobody in our party was Asian, I do have to make mention of the fact that this restaurant was designed and decorated using quite a lot of white. White is a color associated with purity, but it's also a color associated with death and mourning and is reminiscent of funerals. I don't know why Americans insist on upscale Asian concepts being so white.\n\nNo superstitious Hong Kong high roller is going to want to start their gambling evening with a meal in a restaurant with so much white; it's considered very unlucky.","date":"2021-01-11 00:14:24","vector":[0.0132809524,0.4588,0.044475,0.0,0.0754333333]}

I made my best attempt at enjoying this restaurant with an unbiased view. Having eating traditional foods in mom and pop shops, it was hard to review this casino establishment. I cleared my mind and my palate and here goes. \nFirst thought. Beautiful and clean interior. I see a lot of commenter mentioning it being too white but I don't agree. There's plenty of red flower accents and neutral tanned color to offset what people called the funeral color of white.  Alana the hostess was friendly and courteous. She immediately seated me after I had called for reservations for one. Service was quick but that's probably because I came in mid day around 4pm. Which was good because I was hungry and I ordered enough for 2 people, maybe 3. First up was the siu mai and they were decent. Were they $10 decent? Probably not because you can get these simple simple dim sum for half the cost anywhere else. If they had exotic ingredients like at Ding Tai Fung, then I would say the price could justified it. Which brings me another dilemma. I heard originally these restaurant served 4 pieces of siu mai which makes sense because Chinese people are vary superstitious and everything great comes in pairs, then the restaurant decided to serve 5 pieces to justify the price. So who does this restaurant cater to? Looking around, it's mostly non-Asian consumers and that's ok but when Chinese New Year come around, I'm not sure superstitious Chinese consumers who gamble a lot want bad luck with odd numbers of portions. With Chinese New Year coming, it's too late to fix but if the owners are reading, I suggest lowering the price so you can fit your servings in pairs. Same goes for Pork Belly Baos I got. While delicious, it came as 3. I think a lower price and 2 is a good portion. But enough about numbers, I'm not here to help the Casino profit and make friends, lol. Last item I order was, the Spicy Miso Pork Belly Ramen. I'm not Japanese and I'm not sure if this broth was authentic but it wasn't my favorite. The miso was a bit strong, almost to the point I'm tasting fermented bean curd strong. I think maybe for a traditionalist, it's fine but for the average consumer like me, it was a bit off putting. I normally drink all the broths in my ramen but not today. On a positive note, the eggs were executed properly and the noodles were al-dente. I would probably leave out the bok choy as that's more of a Chinese thing than Japanese and they use the same pork belly in the baos and the ramen which would be fine but they should slice the pork belly in the ramen thinner so that it could melt in my mouth instead of me chewing my noodles and my pork belly separately. I think the restaurant has potential but execution could use some work.","date":"2021-02-05 18:57:47","vector":[0.096,0.24695,0.0864153846,0.33115,0.2553]}

They even show Korean pop music videos that are pretty awesome even though I don't speak Korean, they remind me of the big production stuff that Michael Jackson used to put on.\n\nPros: Hot, delicious, great service, filling, and reasonably priced at about 10 bucks a bowl.  It's more than enough.  They have a good selection, and they even have vegan options that I hear are quite tasty.  Every appetizer is 3 bucks, so it won't break the bank to try a couple.\n\nCons: Large groups can be difficult, especially when they're busy, but they can push tables to accommodate if need be.  If you don't like fish or seafood, then your options might be limited.\n\nMy favorite: Donkatsu Udon w\/ extra egg, side order of chicken karaage (drop it in your soup), and get the hot tea to drink.

I crossed this place off my list.","date":"2016-10-02 03:33:46","vector":[0.05955,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Americans need to learn that sometimes less is better.  The EU is full of tiny little chic places with a limited menus and seating.

I'm not going to lie and say there is something for everyone here because there is not.  I have an adventurous pallette and will try just about anything at least once.

The space itself is a bit of an adventure to find as it is hidden behind a large wall with just a very small sign identifying the place as \"N7\" which when you open the gate you are rewarded with a very pleasant looking patio and interestingly appointed building complete with a driveway with a classic Citroen in it that transported me back to France for a moment and really gives it a great ambiance. I had expected the wine prices to be more affordable but gentrification has certainly grasped the wine list firmly here.  The canned options are interesting and probably worth sharing with some folks as an appetizer.  The cooked fresh entrees are very small portions so be prepared to do multiple courses and share food more like a tapas experience here which can add the bill up quickly when matched with the wine prices.  The only concerns I have are that the service is slow, the music was too loud and they only have one unisex bathroom for the customers so there can be a wait at times to get into the WC.  I could also do without the \"Asian Fusion\" dashes they add here and there to the menu but that is just my personal obsession with classic French cuisine and dislike of nouvelle cuisine.\n\nOverall it is an interesting spot for the occasional change of pace to try something quite different from the usual NOLA fare but I probably wouldn't put it on my regular rotation due to the very small portions coupled with the higher prices that make it a poor value when compared to other similar spots more near and dear to mon coeur.","date":"2017-03-15 17:31:49","vector":[0.03619,0.0,0.05822,0.2197333333,0.3818]}

Burgers are the epitome of American greatness, and if my waistline is being placed in a precarious situation, it's not going to be at a McDonald's or Burger King.  Five Guys, a \"fast-casual\" chain burger joint, is a notable exception.\n\nThe burgers at Five Guys come in many variations.  You can get 'em with cheese, without cheese, with bacon, or without it. You can get a burger with a bun made of bread; or, if you prefer, Five Guys will wrap your patties in lettuce.  If you like fixins such as jalape\u00f1os or grilled onions and mushrooms, you can get those, too. Please don't skip the fries, which rival those of even the best sit-down burger restaurant. The Cajun fries are by far the best, and they'll put some pep in your step.  Five Guys also serves hotdogs, but why would you want that?  And, if you have a sweet tooth, I hear they make a good milkshake.\n\nI'm writing in the newfound age of COVID-19.  My recent Five Guys experience came after a burger craving while under a lockdown order.  The dark, grey evening was nearly as lugubrious as the malaise blanketing the earth. Five Guys was a quick takeout option, and online ordering couldn't be easier.  I found the staff at the location to be extra friendly, and their happy-go-lucky countenance was a welcomed break.

A staff member sterilized door handles after each customer left, and they brought the food to customers' cars so they wouldn't linger in the store.\n\nThanks, Five Guys!","date":"2020-04-01 03:07:11","vector":[0.0410904762,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

They only use fresh beef (never frozen). They only use peanut oil. They are a family owned chain and, for the most part, employees are treated like family. \n\nSo, you can imagine my disappointment when I first tried a Five Guys a couple years ago at the suggestion of a friend and immediately thought \"I don't like it.\" It seemed overpriced and incredibly greasy. Sure, you got a lot of food for the money but if your restaurant space looks like a fast food joint it still gives me second thoughts about paying fast casual prices. \n\nSo, I kind of let go of the place. After all, there's lots of other places in a city like Indy.\n\nHowever, after a long day at work I was really in the mood for something new today and decided I'd finally give the chain, though a different location, another try. I ventured over to the Eastside location close to Washington Square. It's in a strip center with ample accessible parking, a nice curb cut and two glass doors to get in. You go up to the counter to order, then they call your number when it's ready. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple - burgers, a handful of hot dogs, a BLT, a grilled cheese, a veggie sandwich and a cheese veggie sandwich. They offer both traditional fries and cajun fries and serve up peanuts. They've recently added milkshakes to the menus. \n\nThe pluses menu wise? You can get any topping for your sandwich that they have at no extra cost. With milkshakes, they have mix-ins that you can also add at no cost - the milkshakes run about $3.99 and are one size. They serve Coke products in a freestyle machine and also offer Gold Peak Iced Tea - I was completely enchanted by an accessible dispenser for the iced tea that worked by simply pushing a button. It was cool, clearly marked as accessible and quite thoughtful. They serve meals in a sack rather than on a tray - while that may turn some off, it's better for accessibility and makes pretty good sense. \n\nIt's rare that you go into a restaurant, fast or fast casual, where everyone seems to be getting along and actually working. That happened here. They were friendly, though I'm not sure I'd say they crossed that line into actual hospitality. Still, they did the job. \n\nFood is fairly abundant if you don't know their servings. For example, a \"hamburger\" is actually a double burger. A \"small hamburger\" is a single. I ordered a hamburger expecting, well, a hamburger. I probably would have been happy with a small one. French fries come in 3 sizes, but even the small is pretty generous. They do serve everything a la carte, so don't plan on a combo meal and you can definitely plan on spending more than fast food - my meal of a \"hamburger,\" small fries and large drink ran about $11. \n\nThe food was considerably better than my last visit. While i still wouldn't call it a favorite burger, I definitely enjoyed it and would order it again. It was considerably less greasy than my last Five Guys trip - it's still decadent, but I didn't feel like I was wrapping myself in a fat suit. \n\nBe aware - fresh doesn't necessarily mean less fatty. If Five Guys has a weakness, it's that decadence level. These are burgers and fries - while peanut oil may make it healthier, it's still a burger and fries. \n\nThe decor is simple - sort of on the edge of a 50's diner, but not quite and  with contemporary music in the background that's not the ambience they're aiming for - it's not Johnny Rocket's. It was clean and comfortable, though not necessarily a \"relax and hang out\" kind of place. \n\nSo, if you want to splurge on a burger and support a chain known for treating its employees well then Five Guys is a definite option and this Eastside location was a pleasant surprise I wouldn't hesitate to visit again.","date":"2016-05-13 02:42:48","vector":[0.062,0.2707666667,-0.0354272727,0.1597166667,0.0]}

Overall, each of the items doesn't rank as the best we've ever tasted in its category; but, when you factor in that they are all gluten free, you have to give lots of credit to the fact that you really can't tell they are gluten free.  To me, that's amazing.\n\nHere are our reviews:\n\nChicken Pot Pie - $6.95 - These are pre-made and you take them home and bake in 1 hour.  They were a huge hit.  Everyone liked the flavor and we made a special trip to buy some more.  If the price were right, I'd consider buying them and having them shipped to San Francisco.\n\nTake and Bake Pepperoni Pizza - $9.95 - Overall we rated the flavor a 3 out of 5.  Rather than being chewy, the crust was crispy like a cookie.  The flavor was fine; but, the crust didn't taste like a pizza.  Perhaps next time we should cook it less; but, we needed to cooked it long enough at 400 degrees for the cheese to melt.\n\nSandwich Bread - Tasted like soft Hawaiian bread.  It was sweet and the white part would not stand up to a hearty sandwich.  In the Gluten Free category, we prefer the UDI brand of sandwich bread. \n\nBlueberry Muffin - $2.50 - Tasty, we'd buy them again.  You can't tell, it's gluten free.\n\nOatmeal Raisin Cookie - $2.00 - Tasty, we'd buy them again.  You can't tell, it's gluten free. This was my favorite cookie.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie - $2.00 - Tasty, we'd buy them again.  You can't tell, it's gluten free. This was everyone else's favorite cookie.\n\nSnickerdoodle Cookie - $2.00 - You can't tell, it's gluten free. - I liked it; but, the rest of us thought it tasted like an undercooked dough ball.  I think part of the problem is that we never buy Snickerdoodles.  So, most of the family doesn't have a basis of comparison to other Snickerdoodles.\n\nWe will definitely be going back to try more items.  When we do, we'll add them to this review.","date":"2013-02-23 22:37:23","vector":[0.1952380952,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

For example, their spicy garlic pork donburi could have benefitted from some more vegetables and sauce, and the dining area has just slightly more atmosphere than deep space. Also, they serve RC Cola, which is vile. \n\n  However, if you are in the mood for any of the following items, Samurai can't be beat:\n- Sukiyaki beef donburi: stir fried beef and vegetables in a sweet sauce, served over rice and sweet potato noodles. My standard.\n- Yakisoba: Thin buckwheat noodles with a variety of meats and vegetables. Solid. \n- Tonkotsu ramen: Ramen noodles in a pork bone broth. One of the best things I have ever tasted. Good enough to justify ordering soup in the middle of summer.\n- Spicy albacore hand roll: Outstanding. $3. \n- Cold ramen: with tofu, ham, bean sprouts and a sweet sauce. Refreshing?\n\n  A friend and I have eaten lunch at Samurai 2 or 3 days a week for the past few weeks, and we have yet to be disappointed. The woman who has taken our order every time is incredibly helpful and polite, and the prices are dirt cheap (especially if you abstain from the RC Cola, which should be easy enough). \n\nAlso, on a side note, Samurai is significantly better than Yoshimatsu. \n\nAlso also, Samurai doesn't seem to have a website, but their Facebook page has a super detailed menu, with pictures.","date":"2012-06-29 23:18:18","vector":[0.1952210526,0.0,-0.085,0.0,0.2202]}

The most recent delivery we have had gotten many things wrong with the order, only one of which may be attributed to a miscommunication.\n\nWhat we might seem a miscommunication was a substitution of brand we specifically disapproved.  Perhaps Charles, our shopper, got his wires a little crossed.  It happens.\n\nOther problems with the order are not so easy to overlook, however.  When one asks for cream soda to be delivered and the delivery includes root beer instead, that's not a miscommunication.  That's inattention.  When a bag of shortcakes arrive crushed because said root beer was placed on top of them, that's careless and lackadaisical.  And when the order includes bread that we did not order and which obviously belonged to another person, the term for that is IDGAFism.  And all in one order.  Not good, Charles.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, calling the customer service number to correct the error took another hour, while someone from halfway across the world tried to address the issue from a computer screen and demands for documentary picture evidence of each item (it took said person a bit of time to understand that root beer was not in fact beer at all).\n\nAlthough we were refunded for the wrong or the damaged items, along with the tax, we still have to go back to get the correct items.  With the time spent on the phone, we have spent far longer than we would have had we just gone out for the items ourselves.  The company refused to refund either the service charge or the tip.  Did I mention that our shopper was named Charles?\n\nThis so-called service is not free and the whole point of using it is either to save time or to handle the challenge of being home bound.  I sympathize with those who are truly stuck at home.\n\nFor those who are homebound, I recommend they use Kroger, which has its own delivery service and can be trusted to pack the bags with some degree of care and responsibility\n\nPublix will claim that Instacart is a totally separate service, unaffiliated with the store.  However, if you look online, you will find Publix advertises the option for delivery and encourages customers to use the service.  In fact, this is the only option for delivery.  They bear responsibility for the mistakes of that service and deserve the hit they get from a bad review.\n\nAs for Charles, I can only hope that he quickly gets the help he needs.","date":"2021-03-17 23:46:37","vector":[-0.0468333333,0.1101,-0.07945,0.0,0.4939]}

For many years, people shuffled about each day, so absorbed in their daily routines that they never even noticed the shop's unusual albeit unique storefront; a cluster of rudimentary wire birdcages with open tops and protruding twigs, allowing for beautifully colored exotic birds to come and go as they pleased. Magnificent crafted toys of wood eerily reminiscent of the great DaVinci. A friendly black cat named Ishmael who appeared to meander throughout the shop much like a ghost, disappearing and reappearing when he saw fit to do so. And books! So many books! For a shop so small, the book shelves seemed to span endlessly. Only the Library of Alexandria might have rivaled its collection. \n\nThe proud owner of the shop was called Tasso. No one knew much about him other than that he reminded many of a jolly grandfather. His smile was contagious, his heart was warm and well, that was enough to satisfy just about anyone.\n\nOn a particularly hot summer day, the shop's front door bell chimed and in stepped an elegantly dressed gentleman. He politely removed his hat and proceeded to the counter. \"It's been much too long, Baron!\" Tasso exclaimed excitedly.\n\n\"Ahh, the last days of the week are finally upon us, my good Tasso!\" Baron Montesquieu proudly proclaimed as Tasso anxiously greeted him. \"Therefore, my wife and I would very much like to partake of the coming evening's splendors. Perhaps you've a potent recipe with which I might conceive a meal so grand that it may illicit overwhelming sensations of pleasure and exhilaration that sweep her feet from the ground below?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\" Tasso exclaimed. \"I'm quite sure I have just the recipe your heart desires.  I'll just have my scribe summon it for you. Caius!  Caius, where are you, boy?\"\n\n\"I'm sorting your records, Sir, just as you asked me to do\" the young Caius humbly replied.\n\nTasso shuffled to the rear of his shop and shouted up to the young boy who was perched upon a ladder near the vast bookcases; his scrawny frame twisted from the weight of Tasso's large volumes.  He peered down from above like a protective gargoyle hunched on the corner of the town's bell tower.  \n\nYou'll mind your tone when speaking to me, boy!\" Tasso admonished. \"The regal Count Montesquieu has delivered us a quest so come down at once! We mustn't keep him waiting!\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir\" Caius affirmed.  Placing the volumes on the shelf, the young boy quickly shimmied down the ladder and stood at attention before Tasso.\n\n\"Caius, my mind is not what it once was...Please, retrieve my ancient codex from the study. The formula must be precise; otherwise we might bring great peril upon Baron Montesquieu! Quick, quick now, boy! Do as I say and make haste! The Baron is waiting!\" At that moment, Tasso appeared to have lost himself in deep thought. \"Ahh, it has been many years since my eyes did gaze upon that old, dusty tome!\"\n\n\"I've found it, Sire! There appear to be the scribbles detailing strange women, indeed and their place of residence! Methinks I have the wrong book! Could this be your old address book, Sire?\" Caius inquired shockingly.\n\n\"Foolish child! Tasso cried. \"How dare you so leisurely peruse my personal files! That was a time long ago! Long ago, I say again! Come now, purge your mind of such perverse thoughts and help me back to the storefront.\" The boy took hold of Tasso's arm and guided him through the narrow bookshelves.\n\nThe baron stood patiently at the counter admiring the many antiques from various regions of the world when Tasso addressed him. \"My sincerest apologies, Baron but my mind fails me for it appears that I've misplaced my book of recipes.\"\n\n\"Oh, goodness me!\" exclaimed the Baron. \"Whatever will I do? Your knowledge and wisdom has steered me straight for ages, Tasso! Tell me what I should do and I'll do it!\"\n\n\"Fear not, Baron, for you shan't fall short this good night!\" Tasso stated firmly, wagging his finger with affirmation. \"On the corner of Robert St. and Prytania resides a quaint restaurant, perfect to impress your wife! Its name is La Crepe Nanou. Its staff serves exemplary French cuisine and on a cool evening, you are permitted to dine outside, romanced by the stars. Might I suggest for an entr\u00e9e both the superb Crepe au Poulet in white wine sauce and the mouth-watering take on the classic dish, Ratatouille, the Crepe Provencale. For dessert, finish with the Crepe Suzette; delectable orange cream and Grand Marnier flambe'.\"\n\n\"From the deepest recesses of my heart, I thank you most sincerely\" said Baron Montesquieu, bowing slightly. \"My wife will be thrilled!\" As swiftly as he had arrived, the Baron was gone.\n\nTasso turned to his young scribe and patted the boy affectionately upon his shoulder. \"This above all lad, remember always to be kind. Do great things with love, for it is the greatest force in the universe.\"\n\nFIN","date":"2015-07-28 18:41:41","vector":[0.2378916667,0.0,0.0,0.1463208333,0.0831652174]}

I watched it being prepared and was intrigued when I saw it being shaken in something like a cocktail shaker. I love that idea! Because it was shaken, the vanilla was evenly mixed and enjoyed with every sip of the ice latte...as opposed to just having the vanilla, espresso, & milk all dumped into a cup and stirred or worse, not stirred at all and having your first sip be all sugar and your last, all bitter espresso. \n\nThere is only one size available in the iced coffee, and pricewise, it is at a bit of a premium if you compare to chain coffee shops; however, I would say it is in line with smaller coffee shops offering premium coffee produced in small batches. I have a soft spot for small batches coffee, as there is such a difference in taste. There's no bitterness and I imagine this if I were to order drip coffee or espresso, that I wouldn't need to add any sugar or milk because it would just be a disservice to the coffee.

There were two servers on and the restaurant appeared to still be picking up the pieces from a busy lunch. We asked to be seated outside, and every table was either seated or covered in the garbage left behind by parents with kids or groups of people having several beers. \n\nWe ordered drinks and then our food, and waited probably 20 minutes to receive one small, thin crust pizza and the firecracker penne pasta. The pasta was sufficiently al dente, but the sauce was certainly more sweet than anything else; although there was a fair amount of Italian sausage and pepperoni in the dish, there was nothing that would inspire me to label it as a \"firecracker\". As a plus, the sauce appeared to be legitimately scratch made, there were considerable chunks of reduced tomato, albeit canned. The pizza was covered in cheese and toppings and the thin crust was quite crisp and flaky, my wife was thoroughly satisfied, although did question the value of the size and price equation.\n\nConsidering what she was being asked to do, our waitress did an admirable job, but we definitely had to wait a bit to both request and then receive the check. Shortly before we received our food, it appeared there was a management shift change or perhaps a visit from the owner, because both servers and the duty manager came out and began to clean the wrecked patio. Just after we received our food, the server taking care of the table behind us came out the door with enough force to lose the pizza tray he was carrying and he dropped half a pizza on the floor. His reflexes were fairly quick, but the damage had been done, and I had a front row seat for the reaction from the table and the subsequent interactions with the manager. The restaurant handled it well from what I could tell, even though one of the guests was a bit prickly. \n\nFood+drinks+service+tax for this experience equaled just shy of 40 bucks. Not the best value, at least not on the weekend I guess.\n\nIn short, I've been to this location and the one in Cool Springs, and had been relatively satisfied in the past.

From the time I entered Southern Oaks Plantation for the first time we were treated amazingly.  We planned our wedding a year and a half out and from beginning to end, they always communicated just to check in with us to just to see how things were going and if we needed any help or vendor suggestions leading up to the day of the wedding.  I would call Kim at Southern Oaks at least once a month with questions\/concerns about my big day and she would happily assist with no hesitation and without making me feel like an annoyance.... Even though I probably was :) When we finally went in for rehearsal, Mr. Bobby and Kim surprised my now husband with a birthday treat and a glass of champagne because that was the day of his birthday and we were totally shocked.  On the day of the wedding, everything was beyond what I could have imagined.  From the beginning to the end, it was absolutely amazing.  Just to give an example of how sincere and amazing the staff and Mr. Bobby were to us, he personally offered to go pick up a wedding guest that was left by the outside transportation services we provided.  This simple gesture let me know that Mr. Bobby truly wanted us to have the best day of our lives and would have done anything he could to make that happen. The food was the best tasting food I have had in my life no exaggeration. Nothing was nasty or just \"ok,\" everything was beyond good. Especially the \"OMG\" chicken (as Mr. Bobby called it).  I truly had the best time of my life.  It sounds clich\u00e9, but I didn't want the day to end.  A special thank you goes out to Lauren for going way above and beyond at the end of the night.  I could go on and on and on, but I would actually like for people to read the review so I will just end it by saying, Thank you Mr. Bobby and staff for the absolute best day of my LIFE!!!! P.S.

My husband and I married here in December of 2010. Southern Oaks was-hands down- the absolute best wedding decision we made! Even though it's been over five years since our wedding people still bring it up and talk about how beautiful the event was and how much they enjoyed the food. Honestly, they do! \n\nWe held both our ceremony and reception here and even with the December cold I would still have it the same way with the outdoor ceremony. The landscaping was immaculate and the candles surrounding the large fountain gave such a romantic feeling. \n\nThe reception was beyond what I could have hoped for and the staff was on top of EVERYTHING. You honestly will not have to do a lick of work at your reception here-your only job is to celebrate and have a great time with your guests. From decor, to cake table, setting out your wedding favors, clean up, flower arrangements-they do all of the work and execute it flawlessly. They even packed up a lot of leftover food for us to take home when we left. We actually made a special request for a particular beer that they did not usually serve (but our dads and many close friends drink this beer exclusively) and come that night the beer was there! \n\nIf the price has you put off you have to consider a few things- the venue is FULLY decorated (we did not buy a singe thing, the only thing we added were some rose petals because the florist gave them to us for free), it includes high quality tables and chairs, certain areas like the bar and wall behind the cake table have special lighting that can be changed to various colors to suit your needs, the staff is highly trained, you are getting a DJ. There is so much more that should probably be mentioned for the price, but I think I have rambled on enough. My point is that you are not just paying for a location!\n\nOur experience was phenomenal and we would do it all again in a heart beat!","date":"2016-06-08 21:14:04","vector":[0.1590857143,0.0,0.1906333333,0.1415461538,0.0]}

The hash browns were over cooked and very greasy. Once we received are appetizer we took a bite and it tasted like someone deep fried stale cinnamon rolls and put a thick frosting over top. The bus boy came around to take my unbeaten omelette and the cinnamon rolls which we also untouched. When our waitress came by with the check she asked how everything was and we were honest. We had to ask her to take the omelette and cinnamon rolls off the bills. The manager came by and she was also very rude. She asked if we are the food and we said no.

I liked the exposed painted brick inside, it gave the place character. \n\nGot a grilled asada burrito for just over $9.00. The price is ridiculous, because literally it takes 2 minutes to heat up on the grill. The meat tasted pre-cooked. As in the onions were warmer than the meat and yet it was cooked all the way through. The burrito contained grilled meet, beans, rice, lettuce, cheese, grilled onions and guacamole. The cook (who I also believe was the owner ) did ask me if everything was fine with the burrito. He also cleaned the windows while I was eating, which was nice to see (or maybe he knew that). \n\nAt the end of the day, I am going to give TLM 2.5 stars and can't find a reason to round up because I've had way better burritos in my lifetime.

I can honestly say I could not have had a better meal if we'd gone in as a pair of diners in a fine dining establishment, and they were cooking for 125.  We had a family-style dinner, and each dish's presentation was phenomenal.

Honestly, when we got our menus, I wanted to try every single hot dog.  =) \n\nI finally decided on the smoked chicken sausage filled with canadian bacon & swiss cheese, with fried egg & carmelized onions on top.  My son went with the Snoring Dog, a bacon wrapped hot dog with mustard, refried beans, guacamole, cheese, salsa & jalapeno lemon mayo.  And my Marissa ordered the Naked Dog with bacon (of course).  We decided to upgrade one to a \"Dog Pack\" which includes a drink and fries to share.  \n\nWow, each one came out wonderful & yummy!  My order was nice and juicy, and I loved the homemade fries too!  But, I don't know if it was cause I didn't eat till then, but I was still a bit hungry afterward!  My daughter did give me a couple bites of her hot dog, and that held me over.  =)  My son's snoring dog is the Mutts version of the sonoran dog, and it was not too bad.  They both loved their hot dogs!\n\nI would really like to come back and try some of their breakfast items, so I'll update you when I do.  Also FYI, this place is pet friendly!  The owner said you could bring your pet and sit in the patio area.  When you do, they'll even take a pic and post it on their facebook page!  Cool!\n\nAll in all, the place is pretty awesome!

First off, it took 40 min to get any part of our food and there were 4 tables at most in there. Secondly, they were out of beef balls, lamb , had no dipping sauces (cmon,what kind of hot pot place doesnt have ANY dipping sauces) and the broth was beyond bland. The bok choy was old looking and it cost 4 dollars for 3 pieces of bok choy, we also ordered 2 orders of beef and there was a total of maybe 10 slices combined. The service was beyond slow (the waiter was at least really friendly) and we wound up paying 32 dollars (without the tip) for a bowl of bland broth, 3 pieces of bok choy, a bowl of udon and 10 pieces of beef.

Well-priced, lots of options, good service - but most importantly, delicious food. As a ramen lover, I really think this place has outstanding broth and flavor balance.\n\nThe turnover in this area is insane, but I'm sure this place is here to stay. The prices range around 11-15 for ramen, with a generous three pieces of meat with the Terakawa Ramen ($11). The broth is very rich, with a deep flavor as well as delicious noodles with a great texture. \n\nWe also tried the side of the chicken curry and the pork bowl. The meats were, by far, the stand outs. They were well-seasoned and amazingly tender, lacking the fat that most ramen places have. Soooo good. The sauce on the pork was delicious without being overly heavy. The curry had a good flavor, with some carrot cut in (I believe) for texture. Definitely not the best curry I've had, but the chicken was up there. \n\nThe place was impressive for just having been open for a few days; the service was fast, the waiters responsive, and the decor modern. The only caveat is that it is cash only as of September 3, but I'm sure the credit card machine will be set up soon.

Service is nice and fast, as to be expected.\n\nOver the years I've tried just about everything here but my usual is the Kyushu Danji bowl. It's huge! I always eat half and take the rest home to have for dinner. The broth is honestly the best I've ever had - it's dark, almost black in color, and intensely savory and garlicky, though I still do add tons of the fried garlic that they leave on the tables. I came in a bit congested today and the flavor managed to transcend my clogged nostrils! The Kyushu Danji (spelling is probably wrong) bowl has 5 pieces of their delicious pork belly slices that are so good I get chills pretty much every time I eat them, along with a lot of veggies like cabbage that allow me to pretend I'm eating healthy. \n\nAs much as I love terakawa, they can be hit or miss sometimes with things such as softness\/tenderness of the pork, and the flavor of their traditional tonkatsu ramen broth can be a bit bland sometimes. As long as you know what to order, you'll never be disappointed and probably become a drooling regular like me. \n\nAdd a mini curry rice bowl to your order as a starter, they're amazing!","date":"2019-02-09 19:11:25","vector":[0.3091555556,0.4215,0.0,-0.0172,0.31845]}

I went back over the weekend (and then embarrassingly again last night...) and it was phenomenal. The mussels are truly divine - with a green curry broth, roasted sweet potatoes and then jerk-spiced sweet potato chips on top. It's just out of this world good. The lamb loin was also really great, as was the shrimp entree. Though I really do think next time I go (which, at this rate, should be by early next week), I'm just going to do a double order of those mussels for an entree. \n\nThey also now have a cocktail list, which I don't think they had in years past. I can't remember the name of the one I had, but it had sparkling ros\u00e9, ginger vodka and elderflower, and it was really delightful. \n\nBeyond having fantastic food, the ambiance is also perfect. I hadn't been since they re-did the courtyard, and I love the new bar area outside. When the weather is as beautiful as it's been lately, there's really no better place for outdoor dining. The interior dining room is also beautiful - extremely flattering lighting, which is very important. Also the service is really wonderful! The only downside is that parking can be difficult, which isn't even the restaurant's fault. I would just be sure to give yourself an extra couple of minutes to find a spot.\n\nAll in all, I have to say Martinique is once again my favorite New Orleans restaurant.","date":"2012-10-11 14:53:28","vector":[0.2381272727,0.0,0.0,0.5632571429,0.2294]}

I also tasted the escargot app and the jumbo lump crab meat 'cobb salad' and both are worth ordering. The escargot was perfectly seasoned (with spices other than just garlic and butter) and the broth was very dip worthy, so we quickly apportioned all the bread and started sopping it up out of my friend's bowl. The crab 'cobb' salad was also fabulous with lots and lots of crab meat. My duck breast was a little dry but the leg confit was perfect - deliciously crunchy on the outside and mouth watering savory dark meat gaminess on the inside...I love duck! I also tried the rabbit and the bouillabaisse and both were really good. For dessert, a friend of mine ordered the Guinness Ice Cream, damn good! Oh and order the 2004 Rosenblum Petite Sirah 'Heritage Clones'. That wine was drinking very well with the duck and rabbit and bouillabaisse! I will definitely add this place to my list of restaurant to 'keep going back to' and in this city, that is a long ass list.\n\nThe ambience was also very nice in the little French bistro style place.

Usually lunch, sometimes dinner, and sometimes the pastry shop.  the food is always on point.\n\nTo the reviewer who didn't know this was a school, THAT'S THE POINT!!!  How can students get experience serving a full restaurant if they don't do it.  How can get they get experience with catering events if they never do one?  The students learn hands on.  I once ordered a bottle of champagne, and the student waiter had to call over a manager because they never opened a bottle before.  You pay for the ingredients, and because of the school, they get a lower tuition than it would be to cover the cost of all of that food.  Can you imagine the cost if they DIDN'T get money from the shops?  Those ingredients aren't cheap.\n\nBack to the review...\n\nPastry shop - I go here like 2x a week.  The Lemon cookies are TO DIE FOR.  The breads, fantastic.  In fact every dessert I've ever gotten has been spot on, except for an apple pie with way too much cinnamon.\n\nLunch - very reasonable.  When I'm stressed out, I go there and eat there, but normally I get it to go.  If you follow them on facebook you can see their menu.  I go about 2x a week.  Their specialty menus, German food for Oktoberfest, Indian for Diwali, are always fantastic.

Following eight months of intense instruction, teams of students plan a menu and then take over the ground floor to serve the public for eight weeks. You have four dining choices, and since the students are paying for the right to cook for you, prices are extremely low. The formal, more expensive restaurant, Great Chefs of Philadelphia, is housed in a totally renovated parlor-dining room, and the city's premier chefs, who serve as mentors, are as active in the kitchen as the student staff. Three casual restaurants - traditional American, Italian, and a brasserie - offer a wide array of options, including three-course meals for as low as $13, with varying degrees of success. Like lab rats, diners are exposed to a variety of experiments, and while some are less pleasant than others, none will prove to be fatal. Given the inconsistencies inherent in such a program, a grade of three stars is a fair assessment overall.","date":"2005-09-23 14:50:37","vector":[-0.01544,0.0,0.03334,0.2066333333,0.0]}

It took 45 minutes and multiple requests to get our drinks from the bar - which didn't have a drop of alcohol in them.  Our food came out in 4 shifts, after having to tell the waiter every time we saw him that we were still missing meals.  -May I add, that after looking around we realized that the restaurant was far from being packed.  Many tables were open.  So, no excuses as to how busy they were.-   The food that did come out was NOT good.  My nachos were like goulash. I had to eat them with a fork and after 3 bites, I couldn't eat any more. Ugh!  After 2 and a half hours of telling the waiter we were still waiting on our friend's Fajitas, we said cancel the order and give us the checks so we can leave.  After 20 more minutes they bring out our checks, and his fajitas.  At that point that was an insult.  Not to mention, there was an extra meal and drink from the bar on our check that no one at our table even ordered.  After all was said and done, my husband and I paid $33 some odd dollars for 2 horrible meals and a sweet tea.  SO NOT WORTH IT!  We were not alone in this nightmare, either.  As we left we saw multiple table disputing charges on their checks and getting frustrated with the wait staff.  To top it off, half way through our time there, drinks started coming to tables in red plastic cups.  Really?  A restaurant that ran out of real glasses? What a joke!  Take it from me when I say - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!  We went straight to Chili's after leaving and got great Fajitas and Margarita's in a timely manner with  great service!  should've gone there to begin with. *I did not want to give it even 1 star,  zero stars is what this place deserves.*","date":"2012-05-07 11:08:10","vector":[0.2565090909,-0.1755666667,-0.2425,0.0,0.0]}

Ask for one.\n\nThe food was simply incredible! My guests feasted on three courses of hot appetizers, we had jumbo garlic fried shrimp (to die for!), calamari with jalepenos (crisp, crunchy, full of flavor), steak spring rolls (beefy, cheesy, yummy), cheese fries and Dave was nice enough to add spicy buffalo wings to my party food menu for the night. Some of my guest ordered other items as well, the crab cakes got rave reviews!\n\nThe DJ kept us dancing all night with a combination of dance music, pop music and selections from a playlist I gave to Dave, I danced almost the entire night!\n\nMost importantly the staff was the nicest most attentive people ever, the wait staff was always smiling, full of personality and eager to please. The bar staff never had anyone wait longer than a few seconds to place thier drink order. Even the security guard was nice (big dude-I wouldn't mess with him!) but he was very kind and cordial the entire night.\n\nYou know you can have great ambiance, food and music but if the staff isn't up to par it can ruin a night.

This is a very considerate personal touch. \nRoula his main amazing server is always on the ball, she is quick, very intelligent, and knows exactly what she is doing. Amazing woman. \nI had a couple glasses of their new wine, San Antonio Red, this wine is up my alley as it was very light bodied, with hints of blackberry and cherry. \nWe started off with an appetizer of bocconcini y pomodoro, with a small amount of bread, olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \nHere is where it gets good, I haven't been here for quite some time and as I had my first taste of my entree......I needed a minute because I realized a couple flavours were hitting different parts of my tongue and were creating that \"AHhhwe\" sensation in the pleasure centre of my brain. It was amazing and I haven't had that happen for quite some time. The entree I had was the \"Cannelloni Piccolino\". \nMy boyfriend had the \"Pizzaiola\" which is veal in a Tomato, onion and caper sauce. I had a bite of his and found the flavour quite nice and meat extremely tender. \nWell, now for the sweet stuff, their dessert is made in house and some are made to order.....no one does that anymore.\nThe dessert made to order is the \"Zabaglione\" this an acquired taste for developed palates, don't be getting this if you have not eaten it before. For those that have eaten this dessert.....it's f bombing amazing, and growing on me, reminding me of my moms homemade poppyseed chiffon cakes. \nThe other amazing dessert of course is the \"Tiramisu\" god how I love it so much. \nOnce we were done everything Lino came and had a seat with us, bought us a couple rounds of Grappa, peach grappa for me lol and we caught up for an hour. What an amazing owner. Love the guy, he cares so much about his business and the people coming into enjoy the food and atmosphere. \n\nEnjoy","date":"2017-03-04 22:58:09","vector":[0.1422047619,0.0,0.0,0.1906333333,0.0]}

The waitress checked on us frequently and kept us pretty hydrated.  As time passed,  we noticed that the restaurant was delivering food to tables that were seated after us and even sat new customers after those folks left and feed them too!\n\nWe asked our waitress, what's going on with our food? She replied,  \"hasn't the manager been out to talk to you?\"  We said, \"no\" and our waitress said, \"I will ask her again to come out and talk to you.\"  A short time later, a young lady came out and brought us complimentary guacamole and warm chips and said this is for waiting on the food.  \n\nWe waited a long time before we saw our waitress again.  When she came by she asked if we had talked to the manager.

She was very unpleasant and never provided any explanation other than it was busy and the steaks were frozen when we ordered them. Okay...let me apologize for my party ordering the t-bone steaks and for me ordering the cabreria. \n\nWe explained that no one ever mentioned a delay or asked if we wanted to change our order which we could have done hours ago. She pretty much just walked away like no big deal if you are not happy. \n\nAt least lie to me and say you ran out of some main ingredient and had to run to the store. Bring out the food that is ready and feed the antsy children on the table.  Very disappointed with how she handled the situation or I guess how she didn't handle it.\n\nThe food finally came out. I would like to give zero stars for the manager but food and micheladas were still great even though it took hours to arrive. \n\nBTW, the cabreria was fantastic.  \n\nThere was a time when i thought that Bk's competitor was better than this restaurant but over the years the competition started sacrificing their quality and customer service.

It is perhaps the most diluted, zombificated, unnatural, forced expression of what is otherwise a rather celebrated and artistic form of human, aerobic rhythmic movement.  Bypass the convoluted, heavily sedated calisthenics, and you find yourself in a small, dark amphitheater lighted mostly by the semi-circular windows to the casino floor reminding you that you are in a casino.  The place had several people for a Friday night.  Okay, you can't really blame them too much, because A. they just opened without much fanfare, and B. LEX and C. LEX, and D. LEX and E. LEX, etc.  It's rather odd, because it's no larger than Sapphire in the other building, and Sapphire is perhaps the most unsuccessful flop of a lounge\/club ever to ungracefully grace the city.  Perhaps if you combined the square footage of Sapphire and the Stage, you would have a decent club.  Harrah's split their pair and came up with 16 and 17.  Wah-wah.  \n\nOn stage is a DJ with his requisite laptop accompanied by a significantly more talented dancer than outside and low-and-behold, perhaps the first male go-go dancer outside of a gay club.  Okay folks, I'm like all into supporting gay rights and hanging out at gay clubs, but it still jolts me a little to see a topless, buff dude gyrating about.  Could it be male envy?  A challenge to my manhood?  Could it be latent homosexual sentiments deeply hidden within my psyche?  Who knows, but I would have to say that this may perhaps be the future, and I may perhaps just be an old fuddy-duddy who just has to enlighten himself and get with the times.  I mean seriously, all it takes is looking away.  Perhaps it says more about you that you are so disturbed by a topless man dancing seductively than interested in focusing on the lightly-clad woman dancing seductively?  I think I'm just threatened by his big pec's and washboard stomach.  Are women threatened by female go-go dancers?  \n\nThere is a bar in back without any stools.  There are however stools and a narrow table surrounding the lowered area in front of the stage.  You can barely make out the top of people's heads from there.  Below, in front of the stage, is a lounge with sofas.  No dance floor!  No dance floor?  Are we supposed to dance in the semi-circle top level?  I just don't see that happening.  I just think the architect just f cked up.  A dance floor in the center, lounge seating flanking it, that would have been a better idea.  People don't like to dance on the periphery, it just doesn't happen.  The dancers want to be front-and-center.  With the utter and abject failure of Sapphire, I can't imagine this place will be much of a success either, but it is a worthy shot and an alternative scene in an otherwise depressing nightlife scene.  I left and went to LEX.","date":"2014-10-05 01:14:12","vector":[0.2672,0.0,0.0,-0.0654466667,0.1405]}

But I can come away with pounds and pounds of fresh fruit, veggies, and cheese and my bill is almost always under $30!  Try doing that at Trader Joe's or another \"fancy\" grocery store!  \n\nThe lines are often very long, but they move fast and everyone is pretty chipper so it's not too annoying.","date":"2016-04-28 14:27:15","vector":[0.2413294118,0.0,0.06364,0.0,0.0]}

The atmosphere and decor are comfortable and done well, really beautiful wood work on tables and bar. Now, the bad. Our food was terrible. I hate to say it. We both ordered the fish and chips. We knew immediately it was over cooked. It was way too dark and when we bit into it the fish was dry and tough. The seasoning, I think, was good. It seemed to have a nice spicy breading on it. The fries were good too. The server ask how things were and I said it was over done and dried out. She asked what else we would like, so, we tried again. My husband ordered the fried chicken and I ordered the wings with garlic and oil sauce on them. The server graciously left the fries so we could munch on them while they made us another meal. Next meal; no better. My wings were over cooked and my husbands breading on the fried chicken looked burnt. We were embarrassed for them and thought, \"let's just eat it.\" The server came by and asked how it was and seemed to genuinely want to know. I said it was the same and maybe the oil was just cooking too high. She said she thought so too or the oil needed to be changed. So, my husband ate as much as he could stomach and I took most of mine home for our dog. We tried to say we really wanted the place to succeed and were very kind. But to make things worse, no one in charge came out to offer their apologies and we received a full bill. For $40 it was a great disappointment and we will not be back. It did include 2 beers, which was the best part. They do have a large selection of beers so if you visit stick to the beer list because they do not care that their food is coming out in the quality we were served.

You can step inside a radio control room, learn about the USS Indianapolis, check out a model of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, and lots more! I think the museum does a good job of representing women and people of color who typically get glossed over in history books. (There's always room for more representation, but the effort is there.) You can search for people you know from Indiana who served in various wars with the computer databases in most sections of the museum.

Its owned by a crazy (in a good way?) Serbian man named George. \n\nI actually met him a few months before the restaurant opened. He was wearing what I've now come to find is his standard daily uniform of dark clothing, gold jewelry and a bandana. When I told him that I've been a magazine editor, and even a food critic for years, he looked me dead in the eye (he's a big guy--it scared me) and said, \"I make the best steaks and fried chicken in the city.\" \n\nAfter a few uncomfortable seconds where I thought he was going to eat my face (he was literally waiting for me to challenge his boast), I promised him that I'd come in to eat once the place opened. \n\nFulfilling that promise I found Tip Top to be... eh. Its definitely a hole in the wall, neighborhood place, but I think George was a bit off his mark in his bragging. The steak I ordered was good, but only because I judge it in relation to its price (around $15). The chicken was seasoned better than any other fried chicken I've had in Saint Louis, but it was way over cooked (friends who have visited since have told me he's remedied that, and that the chicken is awesome). The best part of the meal was that they have a aspiring amateur wine sommelier there that loves to show off (again, in a good way), and once she realized that I knew a little something about wine (I don't, but I'm really good at bullshitting when I smell free booze coming), she quickly drowned me in some free samples. \n\nOverall, Tip Top is a decent place. Its exactly the kind of place you want to go when you're too tired\/lazy to cook, and too tired\/lazy to get dressed up.","date":"2008-06-10 04:10:06","vector":[0.2948,0.0,0.1702,0.15105,0.0]}

I will recommend to ask for the dressing on the side...a little much for me.\nOh and BTW....the special was only about 9 bucks!\n\nI'm sure this is mostly a \"word of mouth\" place since you might not be so tempted to come in judging from how small it looks.\nThere is a really nice patio on the side too .\nIf you're in the area....make sure to give it a try.

There's pizza and pasta on the menu, and a good beer and wine selection.  I tried out the pizza, which was the California thin crust style.  It was very good, although just a little bit soggy in the middle. Overall flavor and texture were right on the money though.

This included Warm Olives, Bruschetta Caprese, Polpette Pomodoro (two large meatballs), Margarita Pizza, and Mussels cooked in a cream or tomato based sauce. Each item was very tasty and surprisingly affordable ($34 for all 5 items).\nThe Polpette Pomodoro stood out because the meatballs were so tender and flavourful. I'd venture to guess there was ground beef, pork, and veal with a fair amount of bread and water which kept it soft and fluffy. If this was the king of the apertivo then the mussels in the cream sauce was the queen. The cream sauce was sooo good we were drinking it like a soup! The crostinis they provided weren't enough to soak up all of the creamy goodness.\nWe also ordered the Burrata which is buffalo mozzerella. The two jams (fig and roasted red pepper) went well with the soft cheese and the whole walnuts brought a crunch and earthiness to the bite. It's a dish that is normally served cold but this felt a bit colder than it needed to be. I prefer it closer to room temperature.\nThis room is gorgeous! It has an upscale east coast feel with exposed brick, lofted ceilings with exposed pipes and beams. The open kitchen allows for great photos and transparency of the food being prepared.\nThe patio is tucked in from the sidewalk and elegantly decorated. Their location is great but does pose some challenges for parking.","date":"2021-09-15 16:07:22","vector":[0.0941416667,0.0,0.1060666667,0.1191,0.0]}

In the last two years or so, the Spotted Cat has become crowded to the point that I don't even bother going anymore, even though that used to be the first place I'd head when I got to Frenchmen Street.  These days, the Apple Barrel is where I usually end up--there's always great music, there's never a cover, and even when it's busy it's not so packed that you can't move and it's not even fun.  People flow in and out, it's a great place to hang out between sets at d.b.a or elsewhere.  \n\nThe bar is cash only, which sucks but what can you do?   Also, last night I learned that there's actually a one drink minimum at Apple Barrel, which is another reason I say it's the new Spotted Cat.  The Cat has always had a one drink minimum, and it's more clearly posted than at the Apple Barrel.  The only reason I know is because the band mentioned it, which was the first time I'd heard them say anything, so it was news to me.  Fortunately, Apple Barrel is often the best place to go if you're trying to grab a drink and can't get near the bar (or even in the door) at another venue, so a one drink minimum is a pretty reasonable request.\n\nWhile you're there, don't forget to tip the band.  If you like the music, it's worth a dollar or two, right?  (It's almost September, so the college kids are back, and I realized that they have no idea what a tip jar is for.  Trying to help spread the word.  This needs to be covered in freshman orientation, I think.

I decided on the chicken salad sandwich with a side of fruit and my friend ordered the Ultimate salad.\n\nSelf seating but like I mentioned it was packed so we had to settle for the last table available next to the fountain drinks. As we waited for our food I observed the female restroom, kitchen, and dining area- all were clean. The ambiance is casual with a medium noise level during peak times. \n\nOur food arrived within ten minutes. The food was delicious with filling portions and I was stuffed. My chicken salad was moist and flavorful however the fruit was not sweet. My lunch kept me feeling satisfied through my evening workout routine and into the night. I plan to visit again real soon.","date":"2016-04-12 22:46:09","vector":[0.14525625,0.2732,0.0,0.075575,0.0]}

I waited 15 minutes, only to get stuck with the same manager again.  She remembered me as the one who \"ate half the sandwich\" and proceeded to tell me again that it would have been different if I hadn't and they do have people call in who have only \"taken a bite\" and they're fine with remaking those sandwiches.  She also told me that she had spoken to the owners and they were backing her with this decision and that it is their policy.  After going in circles and telling her I didn't care about \"policy\" and wanting to clarify that it was out of \"principle\" for me and to make sure they understood that I was not going to come back if they did not offer to make me a correct sandwich, the manager STILL chose to NOT offer me a corrected sandwich....unless I paid half price for it.

I know the owners have put in a lot of hard work (I've followed along watching via social media their journey) and I am rooting for them that this venture is super successful.  I have no reason to believe that it won't be.  Go Adkins!  :)\nWe finally got the time to check it out.  Isaw that on Sundays they will be having slow jams, and they used D Angelo in their advertisement, which happens to be a fave of mine, and the man that makes my husband and I slow dance in the kitchen every time we hear his voice. \nSo.  We went.  I feel like we are slow jam connoisseurs.  The Thermites are typically the only group in town that gives us our fix.  \nCamz was the DJ that night. We arrived at 7.  There were about 10 people in the bar, and 3 of them we knew.  (Great minds)  Most everyone was seated at the bar.  I didn't catch her name, but the bartender was so nice and friendly.  She really took the time to chat with us, make us feel welcome, and when my drink was a bit too strong, she added some more juice and mellowed it out.  I ordered a bourbon and jam drink, and hubby ordered the 2 for 1 redbull vodka.  We ordered a total of 4 drinks, and it was less than $25 which is super affordable compared to other places in town.   I'm typically a wine drinker, so it's not that my drink was bad, it was just stronger than what I'm used to.\nThe DJ was friendly, and played some good songs.  Songs I was really surprised to hear, like some good old school stuff.  She played music that made us want to dance.  The only criticism that I would have is that once in awhile she'd throw in a song that wasn't what I considered slow jams, but it's all good.   It was fun.\nWe saw people come in, go out . .we were there for about 2 hours.  It was still pretty early for late night Reno.  I am really happy that it starts early.  Hubby and I kind of plan on being regulars.  We love slow jams, and there is so much comfy seating available to just chill and listen, shoot a game of pool, or dance if you are feeling it.

The fish was delicious however we were both shocked when the plates were set down in front of us. It was the smallest portion we had ever seen for a dinner. At $24 a plate, the portion should be a decent size. I'm a small person and was still hungry after dinner. We wanted dessert but decided to go somewhere else for fear of another tiny portion. We love trying new restaurants and dine out often. Even though the food was good, we will not be going back. I've worked in the food industry for years and understand that food cost continue to rise. Still, people shouldn't leave a restaurant still hungry after a $24 meal. I don't expect an unhealthy amount of food but enough to not walk away hungry.","date":"2016-03-17 22:13:07","vector":[0.0676615385,-0.0258,-0.074,0.0,0.0]}

I just happened upon Stone House Q one Wednesday night several months ago, and could not believe the quality of the food.  You will be hard pressed to find better ribs anywhere in town.  They are cooked to perfection and have a beautiful bark and color.  They offer three delicious house made BBQ sauces- mild, medium and hot.  They also have a white BBQ sauce that compliments their smoked chicken.  The main reason they are able to achieve such BBQ perfection is due to their smoker which was built in Texas.    It cooks meats long and slow to achieve that taste you expect when it comes to old fashioned BBQ.  Rick Bayless, Wolfgang Puck, Roy Yamaguchi and Tom Colicchio (of Top Chef fame) all use this companies smoker in their restaurants.  One component that most BBQ restaurants pay little attention to are the side dishes.  That cannot be said for Stone House Q, as the owners mother is in the kitchen making the best greens, mac and cheese and brunswick stew you will find anywhere.  The greens consist of turnip and mustard greens and have the most satisfying smoky and spicy flavor.  The mac and cheese is not your conventional mac and cheese, but features oricchiette pasta and  I believe four cheeses.  Brunswick stew is actual a regional stew that is mostly found in middle\/north Georgia and South Carolina.  It is tomato based and contains various shredded smoked meats and vegetables.  I have had the pleasure of having brunswick stew at various places in Georgia, and you won't find a finer brunswick stew than what they offer at Stone House Q.  \n\nI realize this is a overwhelmingly positive review, but I have yet to have a bad dining experience at Stone House Q, and I always leave satisfied.  Please do yourself a favor and give Stone House Q a try.  You will not regret it, and if you have a great experience please post a review to Yelp and tell your friends.

What I can say is Stone House Q has the BEST pulled pork sandwich in Nashville. The meat is tender, juicy, and always has a good ratio of bark mixed in. It is served on a bun that is to die for, baked fresh from a local bakery. I think they lightly butter and toast these buns and they really make the sandwich. The sandwich isn't served with sauce or anything else but they have four sauces you can try. I usually go with the hot barbecue sauce and add a little white sauce too but I could honestly eat this sandwich plain (and I have).\n\nThe sides are very good too. Everything I've tried is high quality goodness. My favorite is the Mac and cheese, it's not traditional Mac and cheese...try it!!! Sometimes they have a pulled rib meat sandwich as a special. It is a must try. It's a little on the salty side but I don't mind that. It's a unique taste and they pile on the rib meat.\n\nI wish Stone House Q wasn't on the other side of town from me. But then again, that probably saves my wallet because I LOVE these sandwiches. Also, you can buy the buns I raved about by the half dozen.

The only caveat is that everything is made to order and you have to pay extra if you don't finish it.

As I saw the bartender pour the booze into the bucket, I probably wet my pants. And hey, it's two for one happy hour? WHY NOT GET TWO.\n\nThis was around 7 pm. An hour later I was sticking to Coors light, my friend and I trying to pick up an engaged woman and her friend who were up from San Diego, and I had to use the bathroom about every 10 minutes. \n\nOh and there was a huge international student group just drinking away and not understanding what the hell they were saying to each other.\n\nAnd there were kids.

Seeing that it's on Penn campus, I imagine that the queues are quite long if you come at peak lunch or dinner hours - I'd recommend taking advantage of their online\/ app ordering program or just setting your expectations. Each pizza is made to order and has to run through a convection oven that only takes maybe 1-3 minutes, but add that to the number of people in line - and that should set your expectations. They can literally only move as fast as the oven as their limiting factor. \n\nI generally order the Moonstruck as I am a huge mushroom\/truffle oil white pizza kind of girl - it hits the spot for both. &pizza is nice because they are fully customizable. You can order one of their set pizzas, and add one other things, or create your very own custom pizza and everything in between for a set price. All pizzas cost the same, despite the sauce, the toppings, etc (except gluten free crust is more)\n\nThis time I opted for Dirty Bird - which attracted me due to the musical label name, but also caught my eye since it's essentially their version of buffalo chicken pizza.

Probably not and here's why.

I've never seen one of the vendors use so much as hand sanitizer after handling money and food in some pretty dirty French Quarter conditions. \n\nBut if you're inebriated and got one of those random drunken cravings, stumble up to the giant plastic hot dog shaped cart and have a foot long.

They paid authentic Greek music in the background, had brick interior with a clean, rustic ambiance.\n\nWe decided to share two appetizer and 1 main dish. Starting with a trio platter of hummus, tzatziki  and  eggplant. Usually, you end up with too much dip and not enough break.... But we had a healthy amount of both. Dips were delicious and garlicky! Next, we shared the meatballs. I was expecting three or 4 large ones, but I think we got 6 smaller sized ones. They went great with the tzatziki. Lastly, we had one order of the ribs. The kindly slit the dish into 2 for us and we and we both had decent sized portions (veggies, 1 large potatoe and half rack of ribs) the ribs fell off the bone and seasoning was a box between bbq and butter chicken :)\n\nThese three dishes was more than enough to fill two people.

That was fine with me... lots of families and kids but a good mixture of college aged as well.  They brought bread to the table that was sooooo Yummy it was crisp on the outside and fresh and soft on the inside. They brought our chicken meals which both of us thought were tasty and we really enjoyed it. It was a good size portion but I was hungry and was able to eat every bite. But we had to flag down a food runner because they forgot to bring our fried mozzarella. They apologized greatly and brought it as fast as they could and they were HOT! I don't know if it was because the hurried to bring it to us But the fried mozzarella was pooled in grease. I picked one up and the grease started running down my fingers. My husband laid them on a napkin to pull some of the grease out.  \nThe runners were quick to pick up any clear plates from our table.  I will note... as we were sitting there. People with parties of 4 or lower could find a seat pretty easily. But if you had a larger party than that... you had to wait a bit. I saw a party of 15 tell the front staff their number and they did their best to snag tables close together as people got up to leave and reserve them for the party pushing 4 top tables together so the group could sit together. So the restaurant is accommodating but you may have to wait a bit. As we were leaving we walked passed the dessert and coffee counter.

The menu includes variety of Italian dishes in pasta, salads, soups, panini (served only until 4pm), chicken, shrimp, veal & short ribs only as daily specials, fresh oven baked pizza, as well as beers, wine, and cocktails.  It offers an interesting vibe of counter-service meets sit-down meal.\n\nUpon entry on a Saturday evening, I was immediately greeted by a cheerful staff who explained to us that I was to place my order at the counter, then find seating anywhere on the inside or their very large outdoor seating patio.  The counter staff were efficient accurate in taking the order. \n\nI decided to sit nearby the open kitchen with god view of all the cooking action. Their kitchen staff seemed to each have particular focus - one for prepping the salads, two for fresh baked pizza, three for pasta, soup, and chicken dishes.  Warm bread and dipping EVOO with mixings along with plates and utensils were served pretty promptly upon seating.  My cocktail came shortly thereafter.  The rest of food came within 10 minutes of seating.\n\nThe bread tasted freshly baked amd a good balance of warmth and softness.  The Lemon Basil Mimosa was a good balance of sweet, tart, and basil essence mixed with Prosecco.  This drink paired well with my Gnocchi & Meat Sauce (Ricotta, potato gnocchi served with classic Bolognese meat sauce with beef and pork). I asked the meat sauce to be served on the side. The gnocchi was cooked just right - perfectly chewy without tasting doughy.  The meat sauce was decent, it could have tasted a lot better if served slightly warmer.  The Italian wedding soup (Chicken, pork, soppressata, pancetta, prosciutto, mixed greens)  tasted nice without being overpowered by any one ingredient.  The Insalata Cotta e Cruda (A raw & grilled salad with salad greens, asparagus, fresh basil, mushrooms, zucchini, red pepper, potatoes, green beans, garbanzo & cannellini beans) with grilled chicken had a nice crunch, flavors of fresh grilled veggies and grilled meat. \n\nThey also have a bakery serving in-house made cakes and gelato.  Although I didn't get to try any of these during my visit, they were presented very attractively. The bakery has a constant flow of customers ordering. \n\nOverall Mandola's is a great casual Italian restaurant that you can bring family for comfort Italian food. The atmosphere is festive with attentive amd efficient serving staff.  The ample seating inside as well expansive outdoor patio seating seem to comfortably accommodate all the customers. \n\nMy first visit was all positive (except the slightly less warm meat sauce). I will have to return during lunch time to taste their panini and maybe their gelato.","date":"2021-12-19 22:59:55","vector":[0.1426228571,0.21075,0.0,0.2435666667,0.2365333333]}

Exhausted from work and came here per my daughter idea since she's really the one in the family that prefers TB since we didn't feel like cooking. Drive through took forever as it always seems to do here. And I swear my only poor TB experiences are at THIS LOCATION!  Sat waiting at the window for our order for over 5 minutes!  It's hell getting in and out of this parking lot, get home and all in my comfy pants to enjoy our supposedly quick dinner......open my Mexican pizza and find very little meat (nothing new) I mean you pay $3 for it so yea sure I'll just take a refried bean pizza. My husband ordered the burrito supreme. Opens the wrapper and notices that it's a burrito but it's grilled on the top--the burrito supreme does not look like this. So he bites into it and notices just beef and lettuce, opens it and it only has beef and a little lettuce. Well, back to put on my jeans and off to TB to get our order fixed. Yup, took my Mexican pizza too because why should I have to eat a soggy pizza when I have to run back up to get my husbands burrito corrected!!??  Oh and did I mention that when I originally opened the bag and pulled out the hot sauces they were all sticky and stuck together! How disgusting. Turns me off from wanting to eat actually. Pull in and they aren't busy...walk right up explained the issue to the clerk who looked unimpressed and like he really wanted to be there, all slouched over the counter. Doesn't acknowledge anything I've said. Merely looks towards the back and waves for the manager. Manager comes from the back. She asks what I needed and I explain to her again since the boy didn't do anything but stand there. She took the burrito opened it and tells me that it's a supreme burrito--I told her that it's not, only has beef in it! I then tell her because of the inconvenience I want my pizza remade. She takes the burrito and tosses it in the trash and tosses the pizza on the counter....walks over to the food prep area and tells them to make a pizza and supreme burrito. She then takes the sauces out of my bag and rinses them off in the sink with water, dries them and places them back in the bin of sauces. Now keep in mind that I left with those during my first visit. Those should've gone in the garbage since they left the establishment and it's a food establishment!!  When the food is ready which was no less than 2 minutes she tosses the bag on the counter and asks if I got sauces from the counter. No apology, no sorry about that, no come again, nothing of that sort. I'm just in awe of how this played out.","date":"2019-09-24 00:06:32","vector":[0.1061212121,0.0,-0.1807666667,0.0,0.0]}

This specific elite review isn't about the quality of the food, because we all know what Taco Bell represents. (Taco Bell is the strip club of restaurants, but it's fine.) This review is about the absolute chaotic way that this TB is managed. \n\nThis TB, while nicely remodeled inside and out, needs a complete renovation of its management - both lower and upper. \n\nConstantly out of food. \n\nHours of operation that seem to vary from one day to the next. \n\nBroken cash registers. \n\nInaccurately fulfilled orders. \n\nIs there even a manager? Or a team lead?\n\nGranted, it's right next to Gaither High, which means their employees are mostly high school kids, but I've been to plenty of janky TBs in rough areas where they could still throw together an awesome bean burrito, with a smile, and never out of food. \n\nI rarely dole out one stars, but enough is enough. Don't let the fancy remodel fool you: you know what they say about polishing a turd? This TB is the personification of that phrase. \n\nI suggest you drive south to the TB near IHOP, even though that one also seems to have erratic hours too. I've come to expect that this TB is always \"out of refried beans,\" so I've stopped going here. What kind of Mexican restaurant \"runs out\" of its staple food?\n\nI suggest you run elsewhere for your fourth meal.","date":"2021-12-18 18:16:06","vector":[0.0912692308,0.0,0.0,-0.18342,0.0]}

The dance side was honestly just kind of lame and tacky. Too many girls in sequined-out dresses and stilettos wobbling around and the DJ, although energetic, was playing pure crap. It appears that the average age of Blue Bar patrons are in their mid-late twenties and thirties. So why was he playing \"music\" that would appeal to 18 year olds? Some kind of booty-bass, thisismyfirsttimeataclub kind of music. Maybe I'm just old now, but I would much rather hear stuff that has actual lyrics and a good beat to DANCE to, not just drop it like it's hot. Also, there were NO TABLES ANYWHERE. There used to be high tables that you could at least stand next to and sit your drink on. The only way to have a table that night was to be part of  \"Jason's\" entourage and then you would be allowed access to the lounge part of the dance room. LAME.

For a $10 cover charge on New Year's Eve, you had two options: turn left (I suppose this is the Rack Room side) and you can sit in a brightly lit white room that has the feel of an old basement and pay $1 per song if you want to hear any music. Had I had the opportunity and the jukebox had the song, I would have torturned the crowd with back-to-back playings of \"What's New, Pussycat\" or some Spice Girls song.\n\nTurn right, and you go down a long hallway to what appears to be the Blue Bar side of the house. No offense to schizophrenics, but I'm afraid the DJ that night was suffering from a bad case of music-schizophrenia. Just as people were getting into the groove, he'd change the tune and tempo and it just killed any mood. Perhaps it's just me, but guys dancing in suits is just weird. There was plenty of that. \n\nAs if those issues weren't enough, asking $7.50 for a Jack and coke is ridiculous...and a poorly made Jack and coke at that. I mean, it's ONLY two ingredients.

I went with a friend of mine earlier this week after a late lunch. The staff were very cheery and went over what comprised each cupcake that we showed interest in even though there are helpful little signs in front of each kind of cupcake covering the main ingredients. However, since it was around 1:30 or 2:00 in the afternoon they were out of a few flavors (which I had been forewarned of) , including bananas foster, which was a special that day. So instead I got the Irish stout cupcake- the St. Patrick's day special cupcake (cupcake + beer, sign me up!), the gimme s'more, and the chubby Elvis for the two of us to try. \n\nOverall, they were pretty okay, but didn't rock my world. The best one was the Irish stout, well because it's a chocolate cupcake that sorta tastes like stout, which is just awesome. The chubby Elvis and the gimme s'more were a little disappointing. The chubby Elvis cupcake itself had a slight banana taste, the marshmallow filling was non-existent (didn't bother me, but still wasn't there), and the peanut butter frosting was bland (Kupcake Factory's fat Elvis is better). The s'mores just didn't taste like s'mores, it was nondescript really, just chocolate looking cake and sweet, bland icing studded with mini marshmallows and pieces of graham cracker. This is the problem I have with \"s'mores\" cupcakes in general- they rarely translate into cupcake form well (Cupcake Jones in Portland, Or nails it). My friend's take on all three were \"meh\", but she compares all cupcake shops to Sprinkles. \n\nOverall not bad, but not great either. I will try them again because they do have interesting special cupcakes each day and they were tasty enough to have peaked my curiosity for another go. Make sure to go early, because they do run out of flavors around and right after lunch time.","date":"2011-03-20 00:21:18","vector":[0.1421625,0.5984,0.4588,0.26335,0.08895]}

For a period, I went once or even twice a week to delight in one of their wonderful treats.  After having nearly every cupcake and special on their menu, I will not hesitate to tell you those that stand out and those you should avoid.  I know vanilla seems like a sure bet, but their vanilla cake is not perfected and does not compliment their tasty icing.  I recommend that you stick with chocolate, red velvet, etc. and avoid their cupcakes that have a vanilla cake.  Their fruity cupcakes are somewhat understandably hit or miss with cakes involving fresh fruits are very difficult to time and get perfectly moist when making them from scratch.  Other than this tip to avoid their vanilla cake, EVERY other cupcake makes your taste buds scream for more of the sugary treat (until of course you simply cannot take another bite because your stomach says, \"No!\").  Among my favorite are: the mint chocolate chip, strawberry icing with chocolate cake (a rare find), red velvet (called I Love Lucy), peanut butter banana (when the cake is cooked to perfection), and apple with a dollop of cream cheese icing.  Honestly, their red velvet is something you can't go wrong with.  It is absolutely SUPERB!  You should definitely give them a try and I promise, you WILL be going back for more!  $3\/cupcake (discounts are given depending on the number you are buying)","date":"2010-03-20 02:16:00","vector":[0.0729464286,0.0,0.1591,0.5719,0.0]}

I would have given this a two-star rating, but in all honesty I really haven't ever experienced a \"better fair,\" and my son had a great time.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy roller coasters...most carnival\/fair rides make me sick almost instantly, as they did this year (after ride #2 I wanted to ride myself of everything above my lower intestine). I also enjoy being able to pay once for a fun card that I can use again and again all year long, for about the same price as I am going to pay (once all is said and done) for one trip to the fair. This is what you do when you are a parent...thank goodness it only comes around once a year.\n\nOnce we were inside and riding the rides we were enjoying ourselves; but only after suffering some nickel and dime bullshit, and some very poor customer service for the first half hour we were there...an inconvenience that makes me want to return even less in the coming years.\n\nWe didn't cover nearly as much ground as we wanted, only visiting the midway before it got too cold to stick around much longer. You shouldn't leave without first winning a handful of fair fish (Penny. Percy, King and Stripe came home with us that night...we had a ceremonious flushing of poorly departed King this morning).

When I say predictable I mean you know exactly what you're in for when you go to the Florida State Fair. The place is always packed and your journey will start with trying to find a parking spot. The lot is huge and they do provide courtesy transportation if you end up stuck in the lower 40 and don't feel like walking all the way to the entrance. This year parking was also free!\n\nThe fair has an expo hall of sort with  lot of vendors selling stuff.  If you come to the fair with children this portion is probably too large and would be considered boring for the kids. But if you are a grown up it is fun to stroll through and see the various wares people are selling.\n\nOnce you make your way through the expo hall and get out to the fairgrounds you get exactly what you expect. If you like people watching, the employees and the patrons both provide top notch people watching experience.  There are live shows of different varieties, a petting zoo which is a big hit with the kids, midway rides which don't seem all that safe, and dozens of other exhibits.\n\nOf course if you are at a fair there is food. I would categorize the food here has carnival food. Pretty much anything that will fit in a deep fryer goes into the fryer and is then sold for consumption.  There are tons of other delectable and calorie laden treats for you to try throughout the fairgrounds.\n\nIf you understand what you're getting into when you go to the fair, this experience will be a good one for you.

I had heard good things of the restaurant and was really excited to try it. The location is awesome and I love the old Reno photography decorating the walls. We first ordered the crab jalape\u00f1o poppers which were pretty good. I ordered a caesar salad and my boyfriend ordered the parmesan tomato soup. He loved the soup, the salad was great except for grated parmesan, which coated the romaine and gave it a less than stellar texture. I think shaved parmesan would've been better. While we were in the middle of our soup and salad our entrees were brought out by a different waitress than the one we had. We adjusted our plates to make room for them and the waitress said \"I don't know why these came out so soon,\" and walked away. I ordered the filet and my boyfriend got the seafood relleno. His food was great and he ate every bite. My filet was really disappointing. I felt like it was under-seasoned and that some salt would've made a big difference. It was served with a red pepper puree and a demi glace. I hoped that the flavor of the sauce would make up for the meat's flavor but it was pretty unremarkable. I've never considered asking for steak sauce at a restaurant but I thought about it here. The mashed potatoes were also lacking in flavor. I feel like if I had made them at home I would've added to them before serving. We finished with cheesecake which, happily, was delicious.

We ordered the calamari and beef skewers.  The calamari was delicious!   The beef skewers were also very good although the quantity was unacceptable.   I understand the concept of upscale but (4) 1\" skewers for $12??   We then moved on to dinner.  The wife ordered a kale salad with salmon and that was also very good.  The salmon was very light and cooked well.   I wasn't as fortunate.  I had ordered the seafood pasta.   The sauce was very good and noodles cooked right but the \"seafood\" portion never made it into the dish.  It honestly looked like minced meat at times with a fishy aftertaste.  The kicker is when i dug around and found my \"shrimp\"   The shrimp used in my dish was BAY SHRIMP.  For a $28 seafood pasta, they served bay shrimp.  That is all that needs to be said.

When I run low, I start to panic and run to the nearest boutique market and cross my fingers they haven't sold out. It's happened before.. the B Happy family went on vacation last summer and didn't make anything for about a week. The stores started to run out. People (me) started to go through withdrawl. Man.. those were some tough times.\n\nSeriously though.. if you haven't tried B Happy Peanut Butter yet, stop by Homespun or R2Go or Goose and pick some up. Homespun usually has samples.. not sure about the other places. A little chunkier than normal peanut butter, this stuff goes great on just about anything, although I usually tend to eat mine with a spoon. Sure.. I've tried spooning it onto a banana before, but that just involves another step and all I really want is the peanut butter anyway. Why bother with the banana?\n\nA few of my favorites: Don't Worry.. a combination of dark chocolate, shredded coconut and almonds mixed with their signature honey roasted peanut butter.  Joy To The World mixes dark chocolate, white chocolate and dried cranberries with the peanut butter.. delicious! So Happy Together blends Inga Smith's Snickerdoodle popcorn and the KeeP Smunchy honey roasted peanut butter into a match made in foodie heaven.\n\nAll of the B Happy products come in 12oz containers, are 100% vegetarian and contain zero trans fats. You won't find a better peanut butter on the market.. and it's made right here in the area (Zionsville) in small batches.. with love!\n\nA warning.. it's addicting.

When I am just browsing, the staff quickly ascertains this and backs off, but when I have questions I have found that you can engage them on a wide variety of topics and they are passionate about food and cooking.  Best of all, if they don't know, they will gladly pull over another sales associate who does.  The best part is that they will have in depth conversations with you about their experience with the product, other products you can use (some much less expensive), and give you honest tips on how to get the most from your purchase.  Plus if\/when you need to return a defective item, they go out of their way to make it painless and pleasant.\n\nSorry some have had negative experiences, but with the new shift in CA sales tax laws for the internet, I shop at WS.  I may pay a little bit more, but I can engage with fellow food lovers, and they have a great return policy.  One final tip: Joan is amazing.  She is infinitely patient, is amazing at understanding the big picture of what you are trying to accomplish, and is spot on with her recommendations and advice!","date":"2013-04-11 16:57:44","vector":[0.2318857143,0.0,-0.053525,0.2263,0.0]}

She tried it once and it didn't work.  She finally went to the store on Saturday afternoon, May 28th, to ask if she misunderstood the directions, and if not, she would return it.  Two staff members were trying to help her when the manager comes up, interrupting the conversation to say that it could not be returned since it was purchased so long ago. She was dismissive and rude to my mother, and had no interest in helping her. She shut the two people down trying to help my mother in the process (seems that she felt her staff were wasting their time with my mom). My mother left the thermometer at the store since she had no use for thermometer that didn't work.  Shame on Williams-Sonoma for charging top dollar and delivering sub-standard service.

I had about ten minutes before going to Ichicoro. I assumed during the thirty-minute drive from my house to Ichicoro I would run into at least one Walgreens\/CVS that was on my side of the road. When I got about five minutes away I was worried this wasn't going to be the case. Luckily, I found this one and swerved into the parking lot. \n\nI went in with one intention, find a sleep mask. I walked up to the second employee I saw (the one that greeted me at the door was too fast for me to realize I should ask someone for help. I need to understand my surroundings before I actually do anything) and asked her where the sleep masks were. She showed me I had two options and mentioned the prices. I was too busy looking at the masks to hear what she said. I ended up grabbing one that I believed to be less than $5 based on the sign above the mask and went to check out.\n\nThis is where time slowed down. There were two people in front of me at the register. Both spoke Spanish and I think all the employees speak Spanish as well. The first lady checked out somewhat quickly (as quickly as you can with cash), but the second one seemed to have an issue with the price they were telling him (he was also paying with cash). There were a couple other employees milling around so I was surprised it took so long for them to open another cash register.\n\nWhen my item was rung up it came out to over $6. I'm guessing it must have been shelved incorrectly. I paid and left. The man to my right was still working out his own pricing issues (which is what I'm assuming since I don't speak Spanish).\n\nI have nothing against this CVS, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to go to it. I would say it is a little below average compared to the other CVS' I've been to, so I'll give it two stars.","date":"2018-04-12 13:15:22","vector":[0.05464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I got a scoop of the Rosewater Pistachio Brittle and immediately, I realized that this was decadent homemade ice cream. Natural ingredients with real pistachios (ones that are not colored green), and an appetizing vanilla base to lay down a foundation. The flavor profile was fascinatingly delicious, and I'm sure that the same craftsmanship goes into the other flavors as well.\nThe owners were friendly as well, and it is clear how much passion they put into their food. The first visit to this place was memorable, amidst the hustle-bustle of the Garage Food Hall.\n\nWhat put this place over the top (and what motivated me to post my first Yelp review) was the sheer helpfulness the owners had when helping me with a birthday gift for my partner. For many years, we searched for basil ice cream, only to find it in one shop in Los Angeles. I asked LICK to see if they would make some, and to my pleasant surprise, they were able to accommodate my special order! \n\nThe basil ice cream turned out to be wonderfully light with a sweet aftertaste. The italian basil was perfect, not too overbearing, and it complemented the heavy palettes of our dinner.\n\nAlthough this place is pricey due to their natural ingredients and the location, I would highly recommend this place to anyone.

A little stingy with the sausage, but in the end, that's healthier anyway... they are more generous with pepperoni, though.  I was told they make their own fresh mozz (as well as their dough for pizza and their sandwich breads.)   I tried the Mergherita, and don't doubt them. Their regular cheese blend is several cuts above the chewing gum other places serve, but the fresh mozzarella was a treat.\n\nIf you are not after a beer, you can pick up two slices and a fountain soda for 7 bucks (but again, where else can you get a 'za and a BEER) ?  In fact, there is a full bar, but a shot of Jameson will set you back NINE Fr$%^n DOLLARS which is about what you will pay at the Four Seasons, so I would just as soon do a shot there, hop on the El and eat the 'za at LuLu's.  They would have earned four stars had they priced their liquor cheaper.  I know Olde City rent is expensive, but that is a bit much!!!  You can go around the corner to a number of bars and get a shot and a BEER for under $9.  Anyway, I'll go back and try some other stuff..I'll just stick to the $4.00 beer, which is about as cheap as it gets in Philly if you're not a PBR hipster.  They have very interesting brews on tap, including a Shandy (beer and lemonade) on draught that is very refreshing with a slab on a hot summer day.  \n\nStaff is very friendly, helpful and willing to chat at the bar if you are inclined.

Their $6 lunch special (two \"you call 'um\" slices and a medium soda) is a great deal, and it doesn't hurt that their pizza is a pretty damn good lunch too. Here's a tip though, the slices alone are $3 each, so if you come any other time of day and don't need a drink you'll end up paying the exact same price for the same amount of food (keep this in mind when you are stumbling up Market Street drunk after a night out). I've also heard great things about their pasta dishes and will probably give one of them a try in the near future, but currently I can't speak for their quality (hopefully that changes soon).\n\nI've only drank here once, but it was an awesome experience, and the bartender was super friendly and attentive. The drinks are very well poured, reasonably priced, and I have never seen the bar really full (this includes when I've been in to just order food). My only real complaint, which also cost them a Star in the rating, is that the one time I was here with my brother (Matthew C) having a drink we saw two roaches scurrying around on top, and generally all around, the bar. We pointed it out to the owner who killed one and then told us \"hey, what can you do, it's Philly, right?\" This might be true in a general sense but I really expect their to be preventative measures in place to keep them from being so conspicuous.\n\nI'll definitely be back here many more times for food and drinks, and I recommend others give it a try too, but if you don't want to be hounded by obnoxious and sloppy drunks make sure to come in before midnight because that's when the real \"fun\" starts!","date":"2012-10-01 20:19:59","vector":[0.1393928571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

But the first test: do they have the quality ingredients I so heavily rely upon, the foods that lure me in that can't easily be found at other grocery stores but are so necessary for my recipes?\n\nI was searching for items like that spectacular Dutch cheese known as Robusto, the jumbo-sized scallops and variety of oysters, healthy-looking fresh cilantro, and many others. And yes, I found all the above. The imperative ingredient tapioca flour that has been conspicuously missing from other Whole Foods is also here, which is a bonus.\n\nThere are only a few downsides. The seafood counter is devoid of grouper, just like the Cool Springs location, so I'll have to stick with Green Hills for that. The size of the store is almost imperceptibly smaller than other local Whole Foods, and it's definitely the widest in town spanning half a block! The overall square footage appears to be about 92% the size of the Green Hills location, and roughly 95% of the Cool Springs store. Hence, it's no surprise that the meat counter is noticeably smaller, with a slightly diminished cheese area as well.\n\nWe all know parking downtown can be tricky. Entering the parking garage will instantly cost you a half-day charge, but thankfully a receipt will allow for validation and free parking. There will certainly be no free browsing here, but they must charge so tourists and sports fans won't become faux shoppers and attempt free parking.

They also have a coffee shop where they serve coffee and certain beverages. Don't expect quality, however, as our experience was not good. My friend ordered a coffee and I ordered a chai. The chai was so disgusting I had to spit it out of my mouth. My friend's coffee was not good either. \nBesides the bad coffee shop experience, I am not a fan of people having to pay to park at a grocery store. Clearly they are marketing themselves to the folks who are moving into the apartments and condos right there along with the future Amazon complex. Most of those folks can walk. However, the pay to park feature to purchase overpriced groceries is obnoxious. This location is great for tourists, and locals who can walk to it. But for most Nashvillians, I can't imagine people are going to go out of their way to drive there and spend money to park to buy already overpriced food.

From the comfortable buzz of the neon sign outside to the old style black and white tiles inside, this place has it all. It just feels like home. The pastries are laid out in the middle of the room, family style on an island. The aroma is decadent. It is truly indescribable how overpowering it is walking through the door.

The cannoli is nothing short of perfect. The shell is crunchy and darker than most. The ricotta filling is unearthly. Heavier, creamier than most, this is a serious dessert. I have been getting these cannolis for over 20 years, and I have yet to find one that can compete. \n\nThe cakes are amazing. Their Italian cream- yes please.  Tarrone, a seasonal favorite, is looked forward to be many as a sure sign of cooler weather. Hell, even the boxes they use inspire nostalgia and a whet pallet.\n\nIf I had to choose a last meal, it would go like this. Fried mac n cheese balls from the Sidecar. Royal burger. Kenzinger.

Staff seemed to have corporate brainwash mentality and operated as if nothing was wrong. Very disappointing!","date":"2018-08-23 21:08:50","vector":[0.0,0.0,-0.5574,-0.020825,0.0]}

The space is a bit strange, in a corner of the hotel lobby and rather than walls there are open enclosures which connect to the front lobby (which means every time the door opens you get a blast of outside air plus you see a lot of legs climbing the adjacent stairs to the 2nd floor bar).  Decor has some great aspects, but then things like the chairs and especially the curtains just look a bit cheap.\n\nAs for the food, it was generally good but every dish had some small flaws which on their own may seem picky but added up overall to a less than perfect meal.  The egg on top of the Lyonnaise Salad was overcooked and didn't allow the yolk to ooze out and meld with the salad as it should - the salad was still pretty good but could have been much better.  Mussels were a massive portion and generally good, but a number of them were gritty and the fries were well seasoned and tasty but many of them were a bit undercooked and limp.  And while the cocktail list was good, the wine list didn't have many glass pours which interested me so we ended up trying two of the three offered sparkling glass pours which were disappointing (and they were served in a wide cocktail glass which I know is old school but just didn't seem like the right choice here).\n\nIt's a pretty good restaurant, with a strange layout but overall solid service and decent food.  They've been smart to keep the menu small with 5 appetizers, a few salads and side dishes, and 5 main course options but at that point I would hope they could execute better.  It's an A-OK restaurant, but I just don't think I'll have much interest in returning.","date":"2017-01-29 17:05:15","vector":[0.1454136364,0.0,0.5023,0.0781333333,0.4437]}

What an awesome experience!\n\nI have to say, the space was much smaller than I anticipated but a beautiful and smart use of space, none the less!\n\nWe pre dined here on our way to the Saenger. Within walking distance. I wish I had a cocktail menu to reference because those were amazing! We were a group of four with me arriving early. I was seated promptly and they do incomplete party seating, which was cool. Cozy table in the corner, banquette seating with tons of pillows. Super comfy. \n\nHost was engaging, smiling, accommodating. Everything she should be. Jean, our server, was over the top enthusiastic. This guy.... LOVES his job and knows his stuff. He was full of information and delivered it with such detail and excitement! I wanted to have everything he described as his favorites! And....we did!\n\nWe started with some apps.... the Foie Gras Torchon (you know, the stuff dreams are made of), the crab stuffed deviled eggs (OMG!), and the scallop crudo. I have no idea how the crudo is made but it was incredible! Light, delicate, fresh, delicious! The foie gras torchon....you must hear how this is made. Painstakingly detailed and worth every bite! The fattiness got better with each taste! If you love foie gras and if you live pates, this is YOU!\n\nWe all got something different. Two salads (which my friends raved over), mussels in coconut milk (crazy good), and I had the poached redfish with a crawfish and tomato broth. The flavors in the broth were so rich and delicious, I could have had it on a shoe and would have enjoyed it. We skipped dessert because it was show time.\n\nI will tell you, we all started with cocktails from a very refreshing menu. I had not had anything like any of the drinks which appeared here. To my surprise, I ended up ordering a bourbon cocktail. I am not a whiskey drinker, but it sounded amazing and it was ! We went from that to a sparkling rose', and rounding it all out with a beautiful albarino.\n\nThe only bit of criticism was drink timing. We ordered drinks to course. Each time, except our initial cocktails, our drinks were delivered when the course was done, making that thoughtful pairing an afterthought. We also wanted to get to go drinks for our walk to the Saenger and it took forever for a simple glass of wine. There was a lady sitting at the bar on a laptop who, I believe, was the manager, as the bartender was retrieving and returning her keys. Seems her time would have been better spent hopping behind the bar and helping out her employee to ensure guests needs were met. That was disappointing. \n\nAll in all, this place was top notch and kudos to Chef Philip Lopez! His love of food and attention to detail is highly reflected in this menu!","date":"2017-03-17 12:58:07","vector":[0.1222972973,0.146475,0.1806,0.1009333333,0.0]}

I ordered the chicken parmesan platter, I explained to the young lady that I wanted a chick parm sandwich with fries and she rung me up for the price. My perception at this moment is that I got the sandwich and some fries, I never had an issue with them before this and they were always very good with food and service. I get my food and its just 4 strips of chicken tenders with sauce and cheese and fries on top. I explained to a white young man in the front counter that I had ordered the sandwich he states that's what was in the order, and I chalked it up to a miscommunication between me and the person who took my order, even though I had specifically ordered a chicken parm sandwich. So, I decided to try the platter anyways, I cut a peace of the chicken and it turned out to be very soggy and the cheese tasted old maybe they let it sit too long. Then I take it back to the store and say to the young lady who always gets my order right that the food did not taste right and that I would like to change it to something else. I decided to go to a buffalo chicken cheesesteak and I even told the young lady not to worry about the change, she brought the sandwich over to my job which was great customer service, I was impressed. I had forgot that I had fries so I went and ordered fries only to be verbally attacked by the white young man that was in the front counter, he stated and I quote \"there was nothing wrong with your food and you should have ordered correctly the first time.\" which I replied \" I did ordered correctly and I received the wrong item and in faith I took what you guys gave me but the quality was not up to par for what I paid for.\" He then subliminally resented that comment and became agitated with me, stating that is not a big deal and that the food was made to the order and repeated several times that I should have been \"honest\" about ordering the food wrong, I couldnt believe that he was attacking me with a customer in frong of him. I was so upset that I immediately apologized to the young lady who had just taken my order for the fries and asked to refund me the money for the fries bc I was not going to sponsor a location that treated customer with such disdain. Nevertheless this experience has turned me off the place and I hope that they read these and move forward accordingly, is a shame bc I work very close and the food is good most of the time until today.

They've been serving for around a week and a half now, and today, the boy and I headed to Purina to give them a try.  Judging from the menu online, I was pretty sure that they wouldn't have anything for him (fish and veggies only), but luckily they had ginger chicken on the menu.  However, to my dismay, there were NO veggie options.  OMG.  I could feel the disappointment sinking in.  But they told me that they could still do a veggie roll (whew), but with no eggplant, as mentioned on the website.  Apparently, they only sold one the whole time they've been open, so they removed it from the menu.  Boo!  But more on that later.\n\nSo mine came in 2 large rolls, with cucumber, avocado, sprouts, and pickled daikon, and a side of wasabi popcorn.  And his came with rice, chicken, red, yellow, and orange peppers, onions, and some bok choy.  He asked for no veggies of course, but they already had everything pre mixed.  This could be a problem for some, and I would recommend trying to avoid it when possible, but it worked out for us, as I ate his veggies for him!  He liked the chicken part of the dish, and I loved the veggies and the sauce, which had a lingering spice, and wasn't overwhelming gingery (I hate ginger).  My roll was delish too, and was a great alternative to some of the other heavier food trucks.  It was fresh and light, and came with soy, wasabi, and ginger for those of you who actually like it.  The pickled daikon was my favorite part (anything pickled!).  I could just eat a bowl of that alone!  And they served each of us a mini salad of shredded cabbage and radish with a tomato as well, making this a pretty large meal for both of us for 15 dollars!\n\nThey have desserts too, like tempura fried twinkies, which I wanted to try, but couldn't bring myself to order.  I will next time for sure, as there will definitely be a next time.  Please please PLEASE have those wok creations on your menu sometimes though guys, and some things with eggplant and mushrooms for us vegetarian folk.  I get that you have to run a business, and if it isn't selling, it's not worth making.  But give us a vegetarians a shot!

It was pretty hard for me to like, much less love, the idea of sushi from a food truck. \n\nBut Chop Shop is amazing. I'm a huge fan of uni and was extremely curious as to how a food truck could serve such a delicacy, so I ordered the Uni shooter. \n\nAbsolutely phenomenal. Some uni, a raw quail egg, ponzu sauce in a small shot glass came together to deliver a ridiculously great combination of flavors in one shot (pun fully intended, but a dose of reality, it's $6 for one slurp of heaven). The extremely friendly and helpful server (Bryce. The kitchen master is Eliott) at the window explained that they actually never break even on their uni but they only carry it because they personally love uni so much and want their customers to also learn to love it. Kudos to them.\n\nFor lunch, I also ordered the Caddy roll. It's pretty substantial with a hefty portion of fresh tuna running right down the middle. Better quality fish, better flavors and more filling than I was expecting (another dose of reality, $11 for the roll). It also came with some popcorn that had been popped with a tinge of wasabi, a surprisingly nice choice. \n\nChop Shop STL has upended my expectations, proving it's possible to get fresh, sit-down-restaurant grade seafood in the middle of the country. On a truck. \n\n5 stars because if it's in your vicinity for lunch, there's no reason not to give Chop Shop (and the Uni) a shot.","date":"2012-06-19 21:10:29","vector":[0.147728,0.0,0.0,0.12765,0.0]}

When making the reservation thru Opentable the only available times were 5:30 and then after 7 pm.  Since we were coming directly from work I chose 5:30.  We were seated right away and we were the only people there.  We each ordered from the restaurant week menu.  I ordered a draft beer, another ordered a Miller and another glass of wine.  Food was ok, I really enjoyed the dumplings, however I did not care for the entree and barely ate it.  One girl ordered the steak medium, however when she cut into it, it was very red.  She also said it was very bland and needed salt.  We waited for our waitress to come back so that we could ask for salt, after about 5 mins we finally asked another waitress. Two of us ordered coffee with included cheesecake.  We finally received our check, a little after 7 pm, and there were only three tables occupied, so not sure why when I tried making a reservation I didn't have an option between 5:30 - 7 pm.

We started to try and figure out why it was so high, then we noticed - the tip was already included.  HOWEVER the bill before tip was $170.  If tip is to be included, most of the time you know ahead of time, I did not see it on the menu, but maybe I missed it.  But if included the standard is 18%, which would of brought the bill to $200.  So when I got home and figured out the tip, we were charged almost 24% for mediocre service.  That is just plain greedy.

On the day of the event I had to cancel the order, and some friends had to go to a different store to get alternative drinks.\n\nThe biggest problem was how rude he was to me.  He kept saying it was my fault, and that I came in too late.  I asked him why 2 months wasn't enough, and I asked him what the point was of calling so far ahead of time.  They said they'd email me, and they never did.  If they weren't going to make the order, they should've at least called me or emailed me ahead of time, and not waited till the last minute.  I also had multiple other problems with them including not giving me keg taps at first, and not having other supplies that I paid for ahead of time.

Though there were initial problems w\/the keg only spitting out foam, half way through the keg completely stopped dispensing beer all together.\n\nMany attempts were employed to fix the problem (re-tapping the keg, using the pressure release valve, etc.), although nothing worked. I've purchased multiple kegs from them before and never once experienced any problems. One of the party attendees also owned 3 bars and confirmed that it was indeed a bad keg. Many people actually ended up leaving the party due to the malfunctioning keg.\n\nThe following day I returned everything to BevMo to explain the situation, although the manager Tim wasn't there. I was forced to talk to the assistant manager who clearly lacked any knowledge & experience to provide helpful feedback (i.e. she couldn't tell me if the date on the keg was the born or expiration date, nor did she know how long kegs remain good for...1st she said 6 months, then retracted and said 4).\n\nI was told the distributor would be in \"first thing in the morning\" and that Tim would call me once the keg\/tap had been inspected. I also left a note for Tim explaining the situation & asked him to please contact me asap the following day.\n\nHaving never received any call back, I was forced to to return to the store once again. Absolutely frustrated at the complete lack of customer service, I couldn't help feeling as though I was getting the run-around. While speaking to an unsympathetic Tim, I was told that they couldn't find anything wrong and that no refund (not even a partial refund) would be offered.\n\nSO after being left with... 1) a ruined party, 2) a half wasted keg, and 3) an inexcusably subpar customer service experience, I absolutely recommend that others try out the Goleta branch instead.\n\nThere's a reason why the SB store only has 2 1\/2 stars out of 5...BEWARE!!!","date":"2013-07-31 23:06:00","vector":[-0.0506888889,0.0279,-0.34895,-0.0902333333,0.0]}

Hip modern architecture meets a social plaza in a way that just doesn't seem common in American cities (re: Italy). I was pleased to discover a new place to go that exudes some of the same \"commons\"-type feelings as the market on 2nd and Lombard, but with an updated feel. Bars and restaurants line the square and the apartments above make me just a little jealous of the occupants because of the proximity of the residents to all of the options there. The community feel is enhanced by people walking with their young families or their dogs; the Piazza is a great place to people-watch, even on a normal day. There is even a giant TV at one end of the square, which is easily visible from the outdoor seating at some of the restaurants. I even saw people who lived in the apartment complex sitting on their balconies and watching the sports game on the big TV (admittedly, the sound wasn't there, but that's easily remedied)! Probably the best part about the Piazza for me is how the eating establishments seem to seep into the square-- one can enjoy a meal outside and be entertained by all of the people wandering around.\n\nIn addition, yesterday I attended the free Winter Jam 2013 Concert sponsored by radio 104.5, which featured Matt and Kim (on crutches) and Teegan and Sara, among others. It was a great concert and caused the Piazza to become completely packed, even on a frigid January afternoon. The bars all had beer stands and were selling refreshments, which meant we didn't have to leave our spots to sit down in the bars (which were already completely packed). We were even lucky enough to meet Matt after the show because we happened to be standing outside of the bowling alley that they went to after the show (he was really cool, came over and said hi, and even shook hands). The fact that the concert was free and surrounded by so many cool eating options for during and after the show really made the night, because we didn't have to go far to find somewhere to stop.\n\nOf course, I would guess that the main downside to the Piazza is living on the inside; the concerts and TV probably disrupt life a bit. However, at the Winter Jam, I saw tons of people on their balconies rocking out to the music. They seemed to all enjoy it, so my cautionary tale to potential residents is this: if you aren't a fan of a large, bright TV in the square and frequent musical gatherings, get an apartment that faces the outside of the complex.","date":"2013-01-27 18:02:20","vector":[0.2137428571,0.0,0.0,0.0335210526,0.0831857143]}

I  really liked the beef tripe (perfect in the spicy broth), lotus roots (crunchy and sweet), pork belly (so tender!), pork ribs (who would think of cooking ribs in hot pot but hey it worked pretty well), pea leaves (best veggies for hot pot). \nI read all the reviews about the service and waiting time, so I lowered my expectations before I stepped into the restaurant. Surprisingly I didn't have to wait for long time to get a table, and the waiter (didn't ask the girl's name) was very friendly. You can tell she was not experienced and might be a little shy, but she did a great job serving the table- honestly, better than most Chinese restaurants' waiters...\nI'm not saying this place is perfect. It definitely has room to improve: the dishes are expensive, especially after paying $20 just for the broth. People cheap like me would really hesitate to order what they want after doing a quick calculation. I understand it's very hard to open and maintain a restaurant in Manayunk (man the turnover rate of the restaurants..), but what they can do is to give people some combo options to help people save some bucks yet still get to try more varieties of food. \nBut I still have hope for this place. They are young, they are learning, working hard, and listening to people. They are introducing one of the best Chinese cuisine to the neighborhood.","date":"2019-04-16 02:02:18","vector":[0.32575,0.2677,0.123475,0.3404,0.0]}

All choices were at reasonable prices (~$8 for a full meal, $1 or $2 a la carte), this truck doesn't over-charge for ethnic food. They also had various refreshments, including my personal favorite: Malta India.  \n\nI decided to order their arroz con gandules y pernil or rice with pigeon  peas and roast pork ($6.00), which was fantastic! It only took a few minutes to come out and I would say it was as good as a home-cooked meal (sadly my family doesn't cook much Puerto Rican food these days because they became lazy!). The rice was moist and the peas also had an authentic taste. The pernil (roast park) was also excellent and really hit the desired taste perfectly, the fat was rich with succulence. Normally I only have this dish during the holiday season, so it was nice to enjoy it for an afternoon lunch for a change. It also came with small salad that had plenty of flavoring from some salt and pepper. \n\nThe employees were friendly with us and the crowd was welcoming, explaining any menu concern we might have. Many people came and went as fellow Yelper Odion B. noted. They accept major credit cards such as Visa and Mastercard, so you don't have to worry about keeping cash on you as well.\n\nI am really happy to have found a Puerto Rican food truck and hope to come back to their empanadas and mofongo in the future :).","date":"2011-05-09 23:05:44","vector":[0.0972512195,0.4939,0.0,0.0,0.5719]}

I ordered several dozen yuca alcapurrias (I guess you can call them deep fried yuca burritos), pasteles (similar to alcapurrias, but boiled instead of deep fried) and lots and lots of mofongos.  Mofongo is deep fried green plantain smashed together with garlic and seasoning, formed into a ball, and usually served with a meat side dish.  \n\nThe mofongo from the Guaguita is outstanding.  I have, however, found an even better one at el Mofongazo.  Now, for the mofongo connoseiurs out there, you will note that pork rinds inside the mix make the mofongo.  The Guaguita uses very heavy garlic but I couldn't see the pork.  The mofongo from el Mofongazo has a lot of pork rinds inside, plus they offer the yuca variety, which the Guaguita does not.\n\nNow, for some this would mean I would go to the Mofongazo and not the Guaguita.  Well, it doesn't work that way.  Good mofongo is good mofongo, rinds or not.  And the mofongo from the Guaguita is good.  I'll be spending more time at el Mofongazo but I will continue to stop by the Guaguita every once in a while.  It's that good. \n\nThey also have rice, beans, and many choices to accompany your mofongo like fish, octopus, and shrimp.  This is a food truck at the parking lot of a Latin market, so I wouldn't recommend planning on eating here.  They have a couple of chairs under a tent, but this is primarily a take out place.

So we brought a lot of luggage and unpacked it all as soon as we got here. So for me to repack and go to another room was out of the question. All I hear is the elevators motors humming and cycling up and down all night long. The room is nice and clean except for under the sink. The lamps have tattered shades but everything else is good , clean linens and all. The problem is they knew the room is a bad room and they stuck me here anyways .  No respect ! I paid well over $500 for 4 nights here just to sleep in a utility room every night . Thats the damn problem. The last night the noise was the worst. I called at 4 am to tell them and they say they can only move me to another room. I have to check out at 11 am and drive 4 hours so I am not going wake my 7 year old to pack and move for 7 hours .

I had heard tales of her epic tamales before, and had to try them. I was solo manning a table, and couldn't find the time to venture out to the food trucks outside. \n\nShe rolls up in the perfect marriage of cycle and food cart, and it's purple...so I love it. Hungry daq goers flock to her...I fear she'll run out of tamales, but she keeps serving them up. I look about and find my chance to run over and check out what she's cookin' with. She had 4 flavors on the menu. I know that three of them were sweet tamales, with the fourth being Pork Tamales. At this point, I had tunnel vision, so the only sweet one I can recall the name of is Blueberry. I bought 2 of the pork for $5, which at the corner of hunger and convenience, I find to be very reasonable. She plates them, fork and napkins me, and sends me on your merry way. \n\nI unwrap these puppies slowly, still steaming from the pots they had been contained in. While I prefer a nice cold, crunchy or limey dish this time of year; these tamales hit the spot. Equal parts masa and pulled pork; it had a heat but not too spicy. I could've asked to borrow the hot sauce in her cart but I was good and already downing copious amounts of water. The masa came off the tamale wrapping easily and seemed to me to be perfectly cooked. \n\nI say rainbow brite because if Rainbow Brite decided to move to the Marigny, turn in the blonde locks for every color under the sun to grace her locks, rock heart shaped sunglasses and funky rain boots...well her street name would be Holly. Let's just say, you might want her to autograph your corn husk, she just looks that cool. \n\nI hope to see Holly again, and venture out to try a sweet tamale!","date":"2014-07-29 17:12:56","vector":[0.0510153846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The whole issue of health care in America is worthy of a good rant - but I will save that for another venue. \n\nI usually go to drug store just for prescriptions so this review is for the pharmacy only. The overall layout is much more open that the downtown Walgreens, but it has a old, dirty, dated feel to it. Staff are cordial, but not  anything exceptional. The clientele are definitely less sketchy but the whole atmosphere is still depressing and run-down. \n\nThe pharmacy counter has multiple partitions - one for drop-off and two for pick up, though there is usually only one person working behind the counter. I am used to a one point-of-entry Pharmacy. Normally, this is not an issue, but I was there to drop off a new prescription, transfer a prescription from Walgreens, and pick up a refill. I ended up having to wait a good 10 minutes before anyone came to help the customer in front of me, then it took them awhile to rectify her problem with the insurance, and when it was my turn, the employee walked away. So, after another five minutes she came back, took my new scrip and got the info on a transferred prescription. So then I asked if I could pick up my prescription that was ready. I was told I had to go to the other window. That entailed another wait in line and having to clarify that I only needed to pick up the one that was ready and the other two I would get tomorrow. \n\nI went back the next day a little after 6:00 and discovered the Pharmacy was CLOSED! I guess CVS does not have 24 hour pharmacies.

The Kristalweizen and Scotch Ale were my top choices and I would enjoy drinking mass quantities of those.  The space is set up much more like a bar than a lot of the other spots with indoor bench seating like a German Biergarten but no outside patio seating.  They also have some random food pop ups.  \n\nBeer prices start at $5 and go up from there which I found pretty pricey for a beer in this locale even if it is some craft fancy stuff it is still just beer in the end and I would drink a lot more of it at $4 than at $5.

Service from Raquel was friendly, prompt and competent. When you go in, there's agents to the left and the right - and I counted at least 10 desks from where I was standing and about 6 of those were manned. It seems set up to handle decently high volumes. Large parking lot with easy access in and out. \n\nI did take away a star because while I was waiting for my documentation to process - I saw\/overheard someone else renewing their license. The agent asked if he wanted to keep his current photo and he said it didn't matter. She asked again and he said that a new photo was fine. She took the photo and the guy came up to her and politely asked if he could see the photo. She told him \"oh, we can't let you see the photo,\" without actually giving him an explanation. I'm not aware of any legislation around this, nor can I fathom any privacy violations - so the only thing I can surmise is that it may be a policy at this registry? Or perhaps just that one agent's policy? I mean - I can see the logic behind it if it's crazy busy - but it totally wasn't. Not to be vane - but if I was told that - I would probably just walk out and go to another registry. Like lady, I don't want everyone handling my license in the next 5 years to see me looking like a troll.\n\nP.S. if you're paying by debit the fee is $0.30 flat.

The staff is useless, and the Manager....well, its hard to believe she is actually gainfully employed. \n\nI just needed to do something as simple as getting a photo id done for my son.  I had the day off so I drove him over here as it is fairly close to home and I won't touch the other local registry because the service is so crappy (oh, if I had only known). \n\nI called this registry LAST WEEK to make sure I understood what I had to bring in to get the ID started.  Today, I walked in with exactly what I was told to come in with....I even went so far as to make sure my son had a bank account so it could be used to verify his address. I had EVERYTHING I was told to come in with.\n\nI got nothing but excuses from the moment I got to the counter. They couldn't do it because he didn't have photo ID to prove who he was (??huh??-but why would he be here to get photo ID done if he already HAD it?????)or could not prove who he was (I had the original Birth Certificate with me to prove who he was.....as well as copies of  his AHB card and his SIN card-which I was told on the phone would be fine as long as we had the original Birth Certificate).  The clerk then proceeded to state (condescendingly)that she would \"give us a break\" and that I could vouch for him and do a stat dec to verify his address(this has NOTHING to do with the Registry-its legislated, and they have to do it if so requested, or if it is an option-there were no \"breaks\" here).  I was irritated at this point and just told her fine, go and get your Commissioner and lets just get this done. She then leaves the counter and comes back with her \"manager\" (probably another staff member)who tells me he can't get the ID done under the guidelines because he is no longer a minor and he needs better ID to prove who he is and to verify his address, he has to come in with a passport or something else with a photo on it.  At that point I lost it. Neither one of these idiots knows what they are going on about.  I tossed their papers back at them, and told the manager I wanted her name, which she refused to give (yeah, I don't like giving my name when I screw up at work either) then I asked her who she answered to at work-her response was \"the government\"-yeah, ok lady.  Someone somewhere is the owner\/boss of this registry and I'm going to make sure they know what a bunch of useless individuals they have working there.  \n\nI went to another Registry and got done what needed to get done with no problems. Yeah....\"can't do it\" my left cheek.   My son is now all set up and just waiting for his permanent card to get here in the mail. \n\nStay AWAY from this Registry.

She told me that if I want to bring it back it better be filled because she was not going to be losing out. I told her that I am asking for my correct drink as that's what I paid for.\nLong story short I took it back, she argued with me and said that that's what I order and that I should have asked to try it 1st and I said again I did not order this but I don't want to argue and that I don't want anything from that business again!

Then the hostess comes after we're settled and says it's against their policy to use a booster seat at a table- she then offers us a rickety phone book as though it's a safer viable option. We kind of look at her like \"how is a phone book safer?\"ask her and our waitress that question (to which they had zero reply) and then ask to be moved to a booth.\n\nThe best part was when our waitress asked very rudely after we had offered to move to a booth (to adhere to their silly policy) if \"we were happy now\". Sigh. Not to mention the death stares we continued to get from the hostess throughout the meal.\n\nThen we see another party getting seated at our old table after us. They are quickly served drinks and food long before we are. The service was lacking in so many ways (like we were moved to Storage B in Office Space), but we continued to be hopeful for the delicious food that was in store.\n\nAfter a very very long wait we received our burgers, milkshake and smoothie.  The burgers were actually undercooked and thrown together to the point where my husband didn't finish eating half of his, the fries tasted like mush and like they were taken out of the fryer about 5 minutes too early.  The milkshake as it were was basically a brick of ice cream that hubby tried for 25 minutes to mush up so our daughter could suck out a sip, and the Hawaiian smoothie I was so excited to try out (thought it might remind me of our honeymoon in Hawaii - was a big gloopy cup of some strawberry mix. CLEARLY not freshly made- but from a packet) that I'm sure would give any healthy young adult diabetes! LOL\n\nAnyways, we were just really excited to have a nice evening out, not only did we end up paying good $$ for crappy food, everything from the way we were treated to when we left (no one even said goodbye) was very disappointing. \n\nLike some other reviews have said, if you go at anytime other than DEAD times, prepare yourself for a LONG wait, very mediocre service and possibly undercooked food (depending on how much they want to rush your order out).

And by picking Saturday night to stop by, I thought I'd give it a fair chance at being lively and happening.\n\nIt's a cute space, however oddly divided in half so I'm still not quite sure what its trying to be. A bar or a wine bar? Or both? Or just one cohesive joint? The bar side was busy so I took a seat on the wine side, and was awkwardly told it was fine to sit there, even though people seemed to avoid the wine side like the plague. \n\nThe half off cocktails sounded like a great deal, and with my $10 for $20 deal I bought through Yelp Deals I was looking forward to a few good cocktails. However, the drinks off their cocktail menu were really really bad. Bad combos that sound good but end up tasting the exact opposite. Like champagne and absinthe...bad idea. I would have been better off with a cranberry vodka.\n\nThe staff were really nice and the place is cute and all, but I'm not sure I'd recommend The Pub. There's a reason this is Santa Barbara's only gay bar, and its best not to get your hopes up.","date":"2012-02-27 23:56:44","vector":[0.07035,0.0897,0.0,0.1147,0.24625]}

But, with that being said, The Pub needs to seriously contemplate what they are trying to do.  By using the old name from a gay bar that closed about 17 years prior, they are representing themselves as an establishment that is again for the LGBTQI community.  I say this because there seems to be major confusion.  There is no official word that is it a gay bar but the hub-bub on the street seems contrare.  Clearing up this matter would do great service to members of the community here that are so desirous to have a local establishment catering to their whims once more.\n\nWith that being said, I attended The Pub last Friday, and was left with a bad taste in my mouth, a soreness on the back side and an empty wallet. Not how you want to leave an establishment.\n\nI know it is new. I know there are going to be shaky legs of new openings.  I know the computers will have glitches.  I know the kitchen is not done, and I know the patio is not open.  So, why $10 tiny (6oz) drinks and $12 corn tortilla sized pizzas with a weird mound of lettuce on it?  Why is the staff not attentive and glad that you visiting?  Being in the \"funk zone\" behind the  scenes should mean delicious cocktails at a fair price and a real reason to make the trek, right?  \n\nThe Pub is not situated on State Street.  It does not offer even a parking lot.  The look and feel of a semi gastro-pub with nice low lighting but is overwhelmed by the glaring 3-colored florescents blasting out of the kitchen nook like an interrogation.  This is so distracting, that when the lights were extinguished and the kitchen closed up shop, a round of applause rose from the meandering curious crowd. \n\nOk, can we talk about seating?  Shop seating is fine in a shop.  Even then, I am not sure how people can sit on these metal stools or short metal stools without gaining loss of feeling in their legs or a pain in the tailbone, literally. This will need to be remedied if patrons are too feel welcome or even want to stick around for a second vacuuming of their wallet. \n\nFor now, I sit hopeful that I will receive an invitation to return and see a version 2.1 of The Pub.  I hope that all the money in refurbishment was not spent in vain, and that there will again be a reason to venture between the titties and sex toys.","date":"2011-08-20 01:03:09","vector":[-0.0002,0.1591,0.3933666667,0.1049769231,-0.02965]}

Well, that's not me but what I can tell you it, this off the beaten path watering hole is great in my book.\n\nDon't blink when you drive down Helena our you'll miss this very unassuming store front. Is it a bar or a paint store? These days it could be Yoga mat or smoke shop. Luckily for us, it's a very comfortable and extremely friendly spot to down some libations.\n\nTwo halves to make a whole with an open kitchen on one side and wine racks on the other. The Pub has plenty of seating space on the floor but the fun is at the bar where it's easy to meet and greet fellow patrons and the bartenders. We laughed until we cried at stories told around the ol camp fire so to speak. The concrete floors, exposed brick walls and hard bar do nothing to absorb the sound so by the end of the night, it was quite loud and hard to hear at times. The iTunes music list rocked with 80s and 90s retro, pop, punk and funk that blended nicely with fantastic B&W photography of David Bowie,  Deborah Harry, Andy Warhol and others by Bobby Grossman.  \n\nHappy Hour until 7 helps the medicine go down with cheese plates, flat breads (mushroom & arugula and salmon were great) and other foods. We all enjoyed ourselves.\n\nWith many many bars to call your own, I have a feeling The Pub will be my new home. It's that comfortable and being off the strip, the people who are here want to be and did not just wander off the street. The only down side I can see is parking. The street can get full with neighboring businesses. Don't let that detract from your adventure.","date":"2011-08-20 17:43:05","vector":[0.1483272727,0.0,0.0,0.0653333333,0.0426666667]}

Near the front doors is the fresh bakery of buns and breads.  We made our way to the right where they have all enticing desserts including cupcakes, cakes, cookies that are self serve and some behind the counter, and nearby is a coffee shop. The self serve donut area was pretty popular with customers filled up their boxes.\n\nThere are some tables outside and inside which is great to eat in.  But they aren't cleaned often as most of the tables we saw were dirty.  We did ask a staff person and he came to clean it for us.  The tables seat 6 so people maybe sharing.\n\nWe continued on and stopped at the sushi area where the Maki combo was $8 for their Thursday special.  They also have Indian food, and hot food including chicken, pasta, and vegetables.  It didn't look that appetizing as it looked like it was sitting under the heat lamps for the afternoon.  Next was the flatbread pizza, calzones, and quiches.  I got them to heat up a meat calzone for $4.  There is one cash area and no line up to it was quick to pay and then snag a seat.\n\nThe food wasn't restaurant quality and more like food court quality if that.

We stayed in the back area since it was less crowded and quieter. But when it gets into midnight, the place was just packed. We really enjoyed the music. I wasn't sure if it was a live DJ or what, but the song selection was awesome! In terms of drinks, they had a few specials on beers, and a couple for shots. The quality is okay. It's similar to what you would expect from a college bar. \n\nSo the bottom line is if you are looking to get your feet move, go there on a Friday night.

I decided to try this place out as I thoroughly enjoyed the other one. The Mystery Cafe is located in the second floor of Milano Inn. Upon arriving, we discovered there was a grand total of FOUR people running the evening. One waiter, two actors, and the host\/owner\/director. \n\nWe were greeted by the two actors and informed that there were 21 parts in the play and 21 guests tonight so everyone would have a speaking role.  They went around and handed out the roles as people arrived and started around 7:45p.\n\nThe play was humurous, the staff was kind, friendly and funny. But I have given 3 stars for several reasons.  First, the food. It was a 4 course meal with each course coming out between the 4 acts of the play. Minestrone soup, salad, entree and spimone.  The minestrone had no pasta in it and instead had cabbage! I've never seen minestrone like this. The salad was pretty good, but chalked full of veggies.  And for the entree you had 4 choices. I chose the chicken parmigiano. It was over cooked and not very good. The best part of the meal was the ice cream.\n\nThe play: I was surprised that there were only 2 actors for the entire play. They were funny and diverse with their characters. But I just felt that I was watching a high school production.  I hate to say it, but even a rehearsal in someone's attic. It was all very cheesy.\n\nAlso, this play was based off of Guardians of the Galaxy and Iron Man, which I have not seen either. I found it hard to follow. Not only for this reason, but also because it wasn't written well. They would just admit characters randomly that would talk about random things.  The play didn't make a whole lot of sense...to me anyway.\n\nI just felt the entire evening was not worth $55. Maybe more like $25.

I've been in here for NFL and NCAA tourney games and its a fun time. Happy hour specials are decent too and they always have at least one good beer special going--like tonight's Kona Brewing Co. Lavamen--25 ounces for 5.99. Not bad at all. \n\nFood is where Bully's sputters. Although there are lots of choices, there is nothing that really jumps out as great. I had a burger tonight and my companion had a cheese steak. Our conclusion was that both were missing something--in the case of my burger, that something was flavor. It had none. Wings (hot) were a mixed experience. On the platter, most of the wings were moist, fall off the bone good with just the right amount of sauce. Several, however, were extremely chewy and had no sauce. Weird. Fries were excellent as were the onion straws (both came with my burger--which was kind of overkill). \n\nService was mixed. Our waitress was quite personable and friendly, our drink and food orders were promptly taken, and our drinks came out right away. Our wings came out right away, but the problem was our main courses came out about a minute later. Since the app was wings we could pick it, it wasn't a big deal, but its still kind of annoying.

I was deciding on the surrounding restaurants and I felt burned out from them. I noticed this nifty looking sub shop and decided \"Why not? Been a while since I had SubWay.\"\n\nBut this place is so much better then SubWay by far. It's cleaner, the food is fresher, it's hot and they've got a good selection of product. One of the best things about this place is the Coca-Cola Freestyle drink machine, while it's a little bulky and not as streamlined as I'd like, it was still awesome. Over 120+ drink selections and a wide variety of flavorings you can add makes this machine worth checking out.\n\nNow, as to the reasoning behind the 4 stars? Well, one of the associates there seemed like he could care less about the guest aside from just taking their order and moving on. He had no personal touch, it was almost as if he were robotic and programmed to just take orders. It's associates like that that really annoy me. Obviously if you want people to return they'd do it not only for the food but for the workers, too. It makes the experience that much better. Now the manager there (noticeable by the collared shirts they wear) was very nice, talkative just right, and attentive to my needs. The second time I went there (because it was such a great atmosphere) he remembered who I was, which always means a lot to me as a consumer.\n\nBut most certainly someplace to check out if you ever want great, hot food, several drink choices, and a cozy, hip atmosphere.

Cesar salads came next, nice serving for price , crisp cold romaine and a very very tasty homemade Cesar dressing.    Then we split the osso bucco (spelling lol).

Expensive but the seafood was very fresh and delicious. \n\nThe \"dessert menu\" was actually a tray of dessert brought to us and described vividly by the waitress. \n\nWe had the chocolate covered cheesecake, white chocolate with passion fruit ice cream and the berry tart.

It is very small, with not a large variety of products. Each type of product may have one, two or three brands at the most. \n\nOne wall of the shop features a cooler of meat substitutes, coldcuts, vegan cheeses, vegan drinks and produce. There is a small freezer that has some vegan seafood items. The other wall of the shop features vegan snacks such as chocolate, candies and jerky. The aisles in the middle of the store cover everything else. There are canned items, boxed goods, coffee and additional snack items.\n\nI like that Black Radish emphasizes local when possible. For instance, the only brand of coffee on the shelves when I visited was King State. The cooler contained a couple different kombuchas, with Mother Kombucha being one of them. Catalyst Creamery, a local vegan cheese company, is sold here. You can also pick up some Oopsy Daisy Sweets. I also appreciate that even though I know my way around vegan grocery stores, Black Radish had items that I've never seen anywhere else.\n\nSome of the items on the shelves were pricey, some were comparable to what you would find at other grocery stores.\n\nI am excited to watch Black Radish grow. I hope they will continue to support local vegan products when possible and give back to causes they feel are important (I visited on a day when 10% of all sales were donated to the NAACP).","date":"2020-06-17 21:43:30","vector":[0.0661578947,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The current owner, Nancy, bought Sweet Olive's around April or May 2013, and has transformed it into a lovely place.  Dave, Dale, or anyone else has since moved on and is longer affiliated with the B&B.\n\nI came to NOLA for business.  Since my days were going to start early and end busy, I needed a conveniently located, quiet and private place to stay.  Sweet Olive's was just that, and more.  Here's the breakdown:\n\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD:\nThe Marigny is a bit on the hipster side.  It's gentrifying, but still has a certain character that only New Orleans can provide.  I walked to Frenchmen St. and the Quarter with no issues.  There are small cafes and coffee shops nearby, even an organic co-op (grocery store) across the street!  If you want to stay in an actual community where real residents of the city are, the Marigny is perfect.  Safety is not an issue.\n\nTHE ROOM:\nI stayed in the Cypress Room, which was comfortable, clean, homey, and had a private bathroom (shower only).  After working all day, it was amazing to take a hot shower and collapse into a room that actually felt like a home.  The AC worked great.  There was a fan.  And the adorable bathroom had fluffy, soft towels, artisan handsoap, and herbal hair products.  (I got a tour of a few other rooms.  The suite looked fantastic!)  Everyday, my room was tidied up.  Even my shoes were arranged and organized.\n\nTHE HOUSE:\nIt's a beautiful, restored New Orleans home with some classic French architecture.  I was able to sit in the main room with a glass of wine and quietly work on my laptop.  SO MUCH better than sitting in a hotel lobby or busy coffee shop.  It was a laid back and well-equipped oasis from work.  (I might have spent some time in the hammock in the courtyard.)  Plus, Nancy has books available for reading or trading, snacks and drinks, and tons of interesting decorations.  (Her Emmy is in the kitchen, next to the dry goods.  Not even kidding.)\n\nTHE BREAKFAST:\nA full spread with continental items and at least one hot protein, like goat cheese frittata or baked egg cups.  Coffee, tea, orange juice, and milk.  Sweet bread, muffins, bagels, toast, english muffins, and all the fixings.  Bananas, oranges, apples, etc.  The menu was printed out and framed with the weather forecast for the day.\n\nTHE HOST:\nWhen I called the check availability, Nancy answered from her car and made plans to meet me with fifteen minutes.  No one else I called was that personal and accommodating, and that's what hooked me.  Nancy was around if you needed her.  She made sure everything was stocked for you.  And she was always a kind and smiling presence without being too overbearing.  She had great tips for the neighborhood if you needed them.  And we had some interesting conversations about travel, etc.  She's lovely.\n\nTHE PRICE:\nAre you supposed to post rates on reviews?  Since I was on business, my budget was fairly non-negotiable.  The room was less than what I've paid at stock hotels in other cities.  And for the quality, breakfast, space, and experience, it was a steal.","date":"2013-08-05 18:00:13","vector":[0.1065666667,0.1405,-0.0306666667,0.0385285714,0.0]}

Too bad I only stayed for one night. I highly recommend this place. The airport shuttle will take you to French quarter suites on The same street and you can either walk or take a bus from there. It's definitely worth the cab ride. \n\nBuffet breakfast at your kitchen table. Very classy. Thanks Nancy for an enjoyable stay.","date":"2014-10-11 19:29:31","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22522,0.0]}

Fast forward to October 2013 when I finally re-booked the trip, deciding against staying in the French Quarter and instead opting for the residential Marigny neighborhood which is when I stumbled upon the Auld Sweet Olive.\n\nFrom my first interaction with Nancy, the Innkeeper, I realized what a special place I'd found.  I asked if Nancy might be able to put together a little birthday basket with some wine and other goodies for when we arrived.   The only guidance I gave was the general type of wine my boyfriend preferred and the price point I'd like to spend.  The basket couldn't have been more perfect.  Pralines, beads, Mardi Gras favors, an umbrella (for Tropical Storm Karen that was making her way onshore), Saints gear and rain ponchos and of course, a fantastic bottle of wine.  Tasteful, charming and delicious!\n\nNancy greeted us warmly, and instantly we felt like we were at a friend's home.  She is in her element as an Innkeeper, though admittedly, I suspect that Nancy likely succeeds at anything she puts her mind to.  We were excited to see what was in store for breakfast, having read about Nancy's deft hand as a baker.  Eggs in the hole, scones, muffins, goat cheese tart, fruit, yogurt, nut breads, coffees, teas, juices...were all scrumptious.  We purposely dragged ourselves out of bed before 10am after some fairly late nights so as not to miss these treats! \n\nWe chose the Olive Room which true to its photos and description was spacious, clean, comfortable and quaint.  Loved the handmade soap and the fantastic bed linens and pillows!  The private exit to the patio proved especially delightful for sitting outside in the mornings and for wine in the evening. \n\nThe taxi service suggested by the B&B was great, prompt and took us anywhere we needed to go, all over the city for pretty much $10.  The neighborhood was safe and artsy with a lot of character which we loved; we walked most everywhere including the French Quarter and  the lovely and lively, but slightly less touristy, Frenchman street.\n\nI could go on and on but suffice it to say we will be back to the Auld Sweet Olive and you should book your room today","date":"2013-10-31 04:42:18","vector":[0.0757166667,0.0,0.0,0.1805941176,0.0]}

Each dish came out as soon as it was ready, which I much prefer when you're sharing; it also ensures that your raw fish isn't sitting on the counter, waiting for the bento to be made. No parasites or infectious bacteria for us, thank you!\n\nThe Tuna Sushi was perfect - temperature, texture, and rice...all exactly as they should be. I try the tuna at every sushi bar I visit and I've had some terrible imitations, where the tuna is as thin as cold cut ham, or extremely chewy (it should never be chewy!), or where the rice falls apart the second you touch it. Mikado's tuna is literally perfect; these sushi chefs really know what they're doing and are able to store the raw fish at the perfect temperature.\n\nLikewise, the Dragon Eyes were - as always - delicious, with a heavy, savoury mayonnaise sauce that complements the taste of the rice and salmon. Be careful not to dip your dragon eye too much, or you'll end up just eating mayonnaise!\nThe California Rolls were as good as a California Roll can get (I wasn't being particularly adventurous during this visit), while the Deluxe Bento was a grilled\/robata feast perfect for two people. Highlights of this bento were the BBQ salmon and beef shogoyaki - grilled to perfection!\n\nOne of the things I love about Mikado is that many of their staff are Japanese - it really adds to the authenticity of the place and their servers are always so friendly and sweet, making for a much more pleasant dining experience.\n\nThe only negative aspect to our visit was that the bill for two people (with one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic beverage) amounted to the $70-80 range. More expensive than Sushi Garden or Kyoto, but of a better quality, in my opinion (Kyoto makes a close second). At the end of the day, though, if you don't want to pay that much, you don't have to - there are plenty of other places to choose from.","date":"2013-10-11 20:55:29","vector":[0.0657864865,0.0,0.0,0.1988428571,0.0]}

My friend and I were asking her what a couple things were but we kept on getting back one word answers. Pretty helpful when you don't know what most of the desserts are in store besides the baklava (here spelt baklawa).\n\nRant - this is for bakeries in general but why do 99% of them refuse to put tiny little name tags with a little description and price beside them so that you know what it is? Seems simple enough right? I'm sure they get asked the same question 1000x each day so why not make it easy on everyone? I get it if you want your customer\/client to ask questions so that you can interact with them but if your not planning to do that, then it seems like a pretty easy thing to implement. Rant over.\n\nAnyways, we bought an assorted box of baklawa ($24.99\/kg). You can choose from two different size boxes (small and medium) - we went with small and got a variety of baklawa pieces. Verdict - so delicious! They were super fresh, sweet (but not too sweet) and melt in your mouth goodness. Could have ate a whole box myself but a) that's unhealthy and b) we nice people so we shared with the rest of our co-workers back in the office.\n\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you are in the area and can get more info from the lady working the front.

It's at least a solid medium hotness.  The guys that work there are cool, but they clearly do not struggle from an inferior esophagus like myself.  :)\n\nI love all things Ybor and will eat at Willy's again when I'm in the mood for some quick mystery meat.","date":"2012-04-05 16:05:08","vector":[0.1260666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The first time I was on a raw diet. That was cool because at seed (all lowercase) you can get raw stuff. It's very expensive. But, it's good, and it's flavorful, and it's raw. That's not why I'm writing this review, though. Keep reading.\n\nToday, we went to seed (all lowercase) for breakfast\/ brunch (it was 9:30 a.m. You tell me.) and we ordered a cup of coffee, and that is a normal thing to order at breakfast OR brunch. It was good coffee. It was fun to watch the coconut milk swirl to the top of the coffee. We were feeling good about the coffee. I knew I needed six cups of coffee, LIKE ANY NORMAL PERSON IN THE MORNING AT A RESTAURANT. \"seed\" (all lowercase) WOULD NOT REFILL THE COFFEE FOR FREE. It was a $3 charge to get more coffee. That's INSANE. Too bad, because the food was GREAT, and we LOVED IT and wanted to eat it joyfully. It was full of great flavors and dripped with luscious flakes of love. Or whatever, I mean it was really good. But we couldn't enjoy it 100% because I couldn't justify spending three more dollars on more coffee. Would it really cost that much to offer coffee that was bottomless, like any self-respecting brunch restaurant? Look. I don't want \"seed\" to close. There have been a lot of vegan restaurants in New Orleans that have been fated to close because of stupid shit like this. Why can't these restaurants just be NORMAL about stuff like coffee?\n\nIS IT CLEAR THAT THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT?! IT IS!!!! JUST MAKE THE COFFEE BOTTOMLESS!!!!!! THEN WE WILL COME BACK FOR BRUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!!! FREQUENTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Honestly, the food is a good deal for the brunch. It was not too expensive and the portions were really big. (Generous, says my partner, who is lying near me and agrees with EVERYTHING I HAVE PUT SO FAR). But I can't go  back without knowing that there is bottomless morning coffee.\n\n\"seed\" owner: If you read this, and are convinced by my argument, please send me a message and I will come back to your restaurant and drink your bottomless coffee and spend $100. Maybe. I mean I'll spend a bunch of money.\n\nOK, also chili cheese are off the chain, and those pancakes are seriously amazing.

I attended 2 weddings here this year, one in June, and one last night. Both times I was very impressed and felt it offered a wholly unique experience that seemed like an escape from town even though it's just on the outskirts of Reno. The two ceremonies I attended were held in separate areas of the farm, but I thought both worked out really well and both utilized the area's beautiful Truckee river backdrop. There is a large grass area which both weddings used to host guests for dinner and a large open dirt area which becomes the dance floor later in the night. Separating the two is a stage which was useful to make speeches. The only drawbacks that I would cite were that both weddings were interrupted by loud passing train horns at some point (not to the point that anything was ruined, but still...) and there's only one bathroom which can make for a long wait. Also, bring a jacket as it cools off quickly after dark and be prepared to leave with dusty\/dirty shoes if you plan to dance! Overall this is a very picturesque, unique, and charming venue that I would recommend you check out if you are looking for an outdoor wedding during the warmer months.","date":"2012-09-23 17:33:01","vector":[-0.13085,0.0,0.0,0.0518916667,0.0]}

The house that is closest to the bridge is actually an air B and B and is gorgeous.

I have searched New Orleans (and even Jefferson Parish) to find a decent wing joint.  Sometimes, I was filled with hope - only to be crushed on the return trip by inconsistency (that's for you, Finger Lick'n WIngs).\n\nAnyway, the wings are awesome standard Western NY fare - no crazy sauces, just plain old hot and mild sauces.\n\nThe bar is on a random stretch on St. Joseph between Carondelet and St. Charles in the Warehouse District.  The bar has all the standards, with the bonuses of Labatt Blue and Molson in bottles.  They also seem to be obsessed with John Dalys - a boozed up Arnold Palmer, and available on tap.\n\nThey have a great patio space out back, with TVs for the games, and a good amount of seating.  The kitchen is in the back, and (as stated above) the wings are great, and the loaded fries were weighted down with bacon bits and pieces.  This is a great spot to catch a game, or grab a beverage on the journey from the LGD to the Quarter.\n\nIf you are a Bill's fan, first I'd like to say that I'm sorry, and next, this is the place to catch the game.  This is ground zero to Circle the Wagons...\n\nThe only fault this place has is the location feels like a \"no man's land\" with regards to NOLA's many, many bar districts.","date":"2012-12-20 20:39:59","vector":[0.17136,0.0,0.2202,0.16664,0.0]}

As soon as we walked in, we immediately noticed that the crowd was a young college crowd and we were probably some of the oldest people in the place by at least 8 years. I'm not sure if this is going to be a regular thing; I think once word gets out about the place there will be a good mix of different types of folks here. The bar was nicely packed at 9 on a Saturday and we were happy to find a table somewhat close to the bar. I can tell they are still working out the \"kinks\" of the place, but I like that the drinks are served in frozen goblets, they have a good beer selection, they have frozen margaritas on tap (and they are actually good!), and the bartenders are fast.\n\nEven though we started at a table, we moved and sat at the bar as soon as there was space. It was a pretty warm night, and although they have some ceiling fans at the bar itself, it was still hot. I can't imagine how this place is going to feel once summer really kicks in. I would suggest maybe a few industrial fans out in the \"garden\" part of the bar, in order to keep the air moving.\n\nOne thing you should realize going in: the entire bar is outside. The bar itself is covered and then there is a huge patio with tables and chairs and I think they are going to have food trucks nightly. I can see Tchoup Yard being a lot of fun once the cooler weather kicks in- I look forward to enjoying a beer here on a crisp fall evening.","date":"2016-07-03 21:35:29","vector":[0.351875,0.0,0.5106,0.078575,0.0]}

I love ice cream and had really been looking forward to trying out Astro Ice Cream. They've set up a cute little storefront near Hemingway's in Armature Works' Heights Public Market. I would recommend that they put up signs describing their different flavors and also what types of cones they offer.  There were four different types of cones on display (including a red one!). I assumed I would be asked if I wanted one but that didn't happen when I ordered and I forgot all about it. A cup of ice cream it was then! Since they didn't have signs up you had to decide what you wanted when you got to the front. This is important because this isn't a place that you walk up and look and the tubs of different flavors.  The ice cream is flash frozen with liquid nitrogen in front of you.\n\nI was in line with fellow frozen sugar addict Brett N.  Apparently Brett gets \"deer in the headlights\" syndrome when faced with choosing his frozen sugar. I actually moved in front of him because I know that chocolate mint is the greatest flavor of all time.  I ordered the \"flying saucer\" off of the menu, which is mint ice cream, chocolate chips, chocolate crumbles, chocolate syrup, andes mints, and mint leaves.  After a while longer Brett finally ordered something. I was surprised when his order came out before mine. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. I waited so long at one point Brett went back to our group and I was the only customer standing there. When I was finally about to ask if they had forgotten me they handed me my cup of ice cream. I was a little frustrated because at this point it was pretty melted. At the time I had never had ice cream made with liquid nitrogen before so I didn't know if this was normal or not.  Now that I've been to another place like this in California I know that it is not. \n\nThe ice cream combination actually was quite good.  I understand they're a new business and they'll probably get more efficient with orders.  I'll definitely want to try some more flavors upon future visits to Armature Works. But with a cup of ice cream costing me $9.10 it would have to be a rare treat instead of a regular occurrence.","date":"2018-04-06 21:24:10","vector":[0.1217157895,0.0,0.0,0.09176,0.0]}

It matters people! \n\nAfter some price comparisons, I headed back towards the counter where this same man met me to ring up my order. I was in there for literally 5 minutes max.

They kept apologizing but there was tables open at the restaurant! I was completely pissed off by this point because they kept making us wait. So I started timing them. My reservation was at 9, we did not get seated until 9:20. Then they allow us to sit there without a menu for another 5 minutes. They came back to take our order 10 minutes later and brought the bread to our table 7 minutes later. So even though our reservation was at 9, we did not get any type of food till 9:42. I'm the type that if I get hungry, I get angrier. So I was not enjoying the night at all. They failed to refill our drinks for a long time and when someone finally offered to refill my drink, that same someone forgot to actually get the drinks. We had to request it again from someone else. Did I mention we had to flag down someone to take our dessert order after 10-15 minutes of waiting? No one came back!\n\nI get that it's New Year's Eve and that they were busy but I was sitting here watching them give preferential treatment to another couple who knew the chef while we were completely ignored.

Even the picky eater,  aka the husband, enjoyed it. \nEqually tasty is the fresconon vegetarian pizza (he wouldn't try that one though). Nice big chunks of artichokes and the tomatoes had a nice char from the oven, lending a nice burst of sweetness to each bite. Just yummy.\nThey have a good grasp on balancing the amount of each topping just right. Not too much of any one thing and it all works together. The salads are also enjoyable as is the spinach and artichoke dip. Will be back for more soon. ....got my eye on the saltimbocca for next time. \nOh and delivery was incredibly fast. The food was so hot I had to let it cool. Made for a nice crust. Crunchy outside, soft and pillowy on the inside.

Not chicken wings, but chicken fingers.  Fried, grilled, or buffalo style--they are all FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC.  Something in the spices they use, but they are different than other chicken finger places.  I personally enjoy the grilled basket--oh and for sides, if you like fries, Texas toast, or slaw, you are in luck.  Not much else!   \n\nOtter's does have a little variety though--you can get a chicken finger wrap sandwich, or just between bread.  They also serve salads--you guessed it, chicken fingers over lettuce.  Not my standard choice, but I've definitely checked it out.  All solid choices as well!  \n\nI also recommend the Otter's sauce...not sure what's in it, but I'm sure there is mayo, some spices, possibly some ketchup...sounds gross but trust me it's awesome.  Other dippers offered are BBQ, ranch, honey mustard, and buffalo.  \n\nBottom line--like chicken?  Go to Otter's.  Great for groups, they have a patio, they like kids, and they also serve some cold beer.","date":"2008-04-12 23:18:02","vector":[0.094952,0.3612,0.0,0.3612,0.0]}

I've been there 3X & the managers\/employees have been rude every time. The female manager is a B****. The first time that I went there was on a Saturday night. I looked around at their selection for 15-20 minutes. The female manager walked up to me with a lot of attitude & told me that I needed to leave because they were closing in 20 minutes. She said they are closing down the cash register & locking the doors now. I had 2 bottles in my hands & was going to buy a third. I told her that I was ready to check out. She said she didn't care & that I had to leave. She walked me out of the store to make sure that I left at that moment. \n\nAnother man was outside the entrance door & asked if he could come in and buy something. The female manager held the door shut as the man was trying to open it and told him that he could not come in. The man said, \"You're suppose to be open for another 10 minutes. I know what I want. I promise that I will be quick.\" The manager responded, \"We are closing & you cannot come in.\" \n\nI cannot describe in words how rude this employee\/manager acted. Maybe she owns it. Maybe she was having a bad day. There was no excuse. She was aggressive, offensive, condescending & rude in her attitude, facial expression, body mechanics & words.

On 11\/11\/2020 I had a run in with a clerk I had never met before.  Okay yes I am not a fan of the mask mandate but did have a neckerchief that I had not pulled up yet.  I make sure I distance myself from others and use it if I forced to be close to someone.  I saw the usual guy I know there while gathering my items and we had the normal friendly exchange.  He has always been nice and recognizes me and make a point to say hi and knows I am a war vet and thanks me for my service as it is Veterans Day.  At the counter there was a plastic shield and besides I was over 6 feet from the clerk behind the counter.  Before anything else he demanded I put on a mask.  I complied and, I admit, I grumbled about it.  It went down hill from there as he became demanding.  I showed him my Veteran ID for the discount as he did not know me and he then in a not so nice tone asked for my real ID.  I showed him my Dr license but then he demanded I take it out of the wallet it was in.   Every other place I have need to show ID I have never been required to take it out as the window allows clear view of my birthdate.  He was just being a dick because I voice my opinion of the whole mask crap.  He became loud and after his inappropriate action I left my items on the counter and left.

I love Cold Stone ice cream, but this location is just very hit or miss. \n\nEach time I've went, I've been waited on by the same woman who seems to be confused about the amount of ice cream\/toppings that go in each serving size, even though I ordered one of their signature flavors. \n\nThe first two times my Gotta Have It container was barely filled and there seemed to be more toppings than ice cream. Yesterday the toppings were non-existent and she mixed so much ice cream that it barely fit in the container. The employee was struggling to put the lid on. When I finally tried my apple pie ice cream, there was very little apple filling and very little pie crust. If I have another craving for Cold Stone, I'll probably go out of my way to stop at another location.","date":"2013-04-01 02:53:56","vector":[0.0318166667,-0.4215,-0.3182,0.0,0.0]}

I made sure to call and double check on the form I needed to complete and proper documents to bring in. If you are renewing your passport you will need to fill out a DS-82 and if you are new to the Passport system then you file a DS-11 form. There is an automatic form generator that allows you to type all your information and then converts your document to a nicely printable form with all your information typed. I highly suggest going to travel.state.gov to complete your form and review what documents you need to bring in. You can also book your appointment for the Western passport center via travel.state.gov.

The first time we ordered a salad bowl and a pita wrap, both with beef Shawarma. We ordered on Grub Hub, and and promptly received a message that our food was ready. When we arrived, the food was not actually ready, but I was informed that they were making it at that time so it would be fresh and hot, which I appreciated. The food was pretty good, and all items were made as ordered. \n\nThe second visit, unfortunately, did not go so well. This time, my wife and I were out and about when we decided to order from Pita Chip and did not want to go through the hassle of trying to order from Grub Hub on a small phone, so instead decided to telephone in our order.  Upon calling Pita Chip, we were immediately informed that they do not take telephone orders and food should be ordered through Grub Hub, but they would \"do it this time.\" DO IT THIS TIME? Really!? With all of the restaurants in the Temple University area, you would think that restaurants would be doing everything possible to attract and keep business, rather than acting like customers are inconveniencing them. Despite their unprofessionalism, we still placed our order, this time ordering the salad bowl and a rice bowl, again with beef Shawarma. Once again, the quality of the food itself was not bad, but both the rice bowl and the salad were missing several toppings we had ordered. \n\nWhile the quality of the food is decent, and portion sizes are fair for the price, the poor customer service along with two incorrect orders was enough to turn us off. With all of the other dining options available in the area willing to try a bit harder, I would not likely return to Pita Chip.","date":"2015-12-06 23:59:06","vector":[-0.1070117647,0.3612,0.4404,0.0,0.0]}

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Renaissance Hotel and had breakfast here. First of all, the hostess was flighty, had us follow her twice to tables that were not ready, she barely spoke a word to us. Someone spilled a glass of water all of the table and floor behind the table we finally got. It took at least 45 minutes for people to clean up the spilled water and that was only after the flighty hostess sat a couple there. Of course they complained about the water. The manager walked by the mess on the floor numerous times and did nothing. Only when the couple sat at that table and complained did he act on the puddle. I should've slipped in the puddle and caused a scene. Let's talk about the food, shall we? Available buffet or order from a menu ( which we never got by the way). Watery eggs, bacon was flavorless, sausage was dry. My boyfriend ordered an omelet. He said is was the worst he's had in awhile. \n\nFor a restaurant attached to a very prestigious hotel to have that kind of service and quality of food is a disgrace!

Maybe a tie with Blueberry Hill, but it's close.  At the old Dooley's (downtown on 8th near Pine), you stood in a line at the grill, ordered, moved along the line as your burger cooked, then told them what you wanted on it, and then received it in a little basket with fries or onion rings.  There was NO wait staff before, so I can understand why the service is not up to some people's standards.\n\nThe problem is, Dooley's new location here on Grand and the new open seating area with clean, nice looking decor belies the type of establishment that Dooley's used to represent.  I know that the new look is because the new location needs to cater to the upscale theatre and symphony crowds; but I hope people can look past what seems like bad service to the excellent, excellent burgers.","date":"2013-06-02 16:07:24","vector":[0.16252,0.4404,0.0,0.3468,0.0]}

Was it because of the beaches? Nope, at the time, I didn't have a beach body, in fact, I was overweight. Anyways, fast forward six years, I have now graduated college, I'm working at a job I'm not really fond of but I've saved up enough money for me to go on a vacation. Without a clue on where to go, I end up finding a deal from Southwest airlines to San Diego and lo and behold, there's a cheap motel that fits my needs in San Diego. Sweet, I don't have to break the bank for lodging and airfare so I book everything. A quick search on Mapquest tells me Santa Barbara is close enough for me to make a day trip to from San Diego. After checking both Greyhound and Amtrak, I chose Greyhound because its cheaper and their schedule allowed me to spend more time in Santa Barbara. I'm sure Amtrak would have been more scenic but that's beside the point. I end up booking a round-trip with Greyhound on the last full day I have on my vacation.\n\nAfter several days of fun in San Diego, and to a lesser extent, Chula Vista, Tijuana, Mexico and Coronado, it's time for my trip to Santa Barbara. Of course, this also means my vacation is coming to an end but at the same time, this is the part of the vacation that I am looking forward to the most. My route to Santa Barbara is as follows, from San Diego, I end up in Los Angeles around 2 AM, where I have to wait until 6 AM before I switch buses in Los Angeles and end up in Santa Barbara a little before 9 AM. Since I can't sleep on buses, I am relying on three things to carry me through the night- 1) my MP3 player, 2) drinking several energy drinks before and during the trip as well as when I get to Santa Barbara and 3) my desire to explore Santa Barbara. Before my trip, I find out that the LA bus terminal is in a sketchy part of town. Even that didn't prepare me for exactly how sketchy it was, especially at 3 AM and the type of people inside it. Being paranoid, I just calmly listen to my MP3 player while keeping an eye out on the people around me and the store inside the bus terminal. Once it opens, I go inside, end up buying some shitty food, an energy drink and a magnet of LA for my dad. My bus finally arrives and adios to the shady ass LA bus terminal. After almost two and a half hours, I'm finally in Santa Barbara.\n\nHaving done my research ahead of time, there are a few places I know I want to visit in Santa Barbara and there are others I can skip. One of the places I wanted to visit was the mission but I couldn't find it, so I ended up not going. Instead, I end up going to a few other places, all of which I have posted individual reviews for. The highlights for me were essentially the Santa Barbara County Courthouse and Stearns Wharf. I won't go into a full detailed review here on either place since I have reviewed both sites individually but there was something about those two sites that for some reason fit right in with Santa Barbara. The atmosphere there was laid back, the waterfront had a calming effect on me, seeing the Spanish influence on the city especially in the County Courthouse was a highlight of my trip and this was definitely a nice place to go and relax for a bit. As for food, I think I skipped lunch, choosing instead to spend time at the various attractions I wanted to visit and I ended up in some Irish pub for dinner. As I walked down State Street, killing time before my bus left, I found a wonderful Santa Barbara magnet I got for my dad and a t-shirt for myself in a souvenir shop. Then it was time to take the bus back to LA then San Diego.\n\nAs the bus left Santa Barbara, I couldn't help but feel a little sad. While I had seen a good number of attractions in such a short period of time, there were still some attractions that I did not get a chance to see (ie the Mission), I decided that if I ever get the opportunity, I would definitely return. Hopefully when I return, I will actually do some work this time and find a decent restaurant to eat in, as opposed to settling for Subway or something like that. There was something about Santa Barbara that made me love it and want to return. Hopefully, one day soon enough, I will come back to Santa Barbara, hopefully with Amtrak or driving this time around. Unfortunately, all good things had to come to an end and this was the end of my short but extremely sweet Santa Barbara excursion.","date":"2013-03-11 00:20:58","vector":[-0.05615,0.0,0.5106,0.0515769231,0.045625]}

Uniquely blending old Spanish Mission town with a college town vibe, plus international tourism, and the beach, with the Santa Ynez Mountains as a backdrop, it's a jewel along the California coast.  \n\nSan Diego also shares many of these elements, but Santa Barbara's natural setting is more contained and visually stunning.  Also, the vibe on State Street is something special.\n\nI've been enjoying day trips and overnight stays since the 80's.  There's so much to see and do that I'm still finding new experiences all these years later.  \n\nYesterday we drove up from Ventura in the middle of the afternoon.  Initially stopping in Carpinteria, we headed into S.B. by way of Montecito, taking 192 winding through the hills.  That's a beautiful drive in itself.  We often focus on the beach areas, so an inland drive among mature trees and landscape was a different adventure.\n\nWe came down State Street from the upper portion, cruising with the top down on the convertible, soaking up the sights.  We parked off De La Guerra near City Hall, which I'd not seen before.  A pedestrian walkway led to State Street for window shopping and popping in to a few shops.\n\nThree hats, a couple pairs of earrings, some jewelry fixings, a beaded necklace, a sterling silver ring, and lots of oohing and aahing later, we were ready for a bit of dessert.  A Yelp recommendation led us to Lilac Patisserie.  More on that separately.  \n\nWe also popped in to Marshall's, which occupies an old bank building.  I scored some beautiful new bathroom towels there.\n\nWe enjoyed our State Street stroll, people watching, and listening to visitors from many foreign lands speaking their native languages.  A very cosmopolitan feeling was in the air.  The bistros, pubs & clubs, coffee bars, and yogurt shops, were all getting rolling for the evening.  Some shops close at 8:00 on Saturday evening, while others stay open later.\n\nWe finished our visit by driving all the way down State to the ocean.  There is a large-scale redevelopment happening on lower State.

They were out of both chicken and turkey at 4pm which was a let down for the non red meat eaters in our group (there is the run out policy posted, but 4pm seems a bit too early especially on a weekly where the restaurant is empty). The rest of the food was so so, the brisket pieces I got tasted good but were 75% fat and one piece was the end so was all fat. The pulled pork was cold and dry. The Johnny cakes and beans were decent sides on their own.

Doesn't greet me. \n\nI ask for the menu and an iced tea. She disappears to what I can only imagine is to brew the tea from scratch. Five minutes later she comes back slides over the iced tea, and chips and salsa. No sugar  for the iced tea, which I find odd... don't say anything because it is probably my own stupid fault for ordering iced tea at a Mexican restaurant.  I look over at the menu and decide that Arroz con Pollo sounds good, so I order that and a side of guacamole with chips.

A young girl shows up and sits them at the bar. Hands them the menu and looks over at me and asks me if I'm ready to order. Seriously?  I tell her I already have, but I would like a refill on my drink. I ask for a coke this time.  She leaves... \n\nA few teenagers start noisily setting up a DJ booth.

She apologizes for not bringing it, rings me up and tells me she gave me a 10% discount.

The vanilla milkshake was a disappointment as well.  The waffle fries were decent, but made me long for Chick-Fil-A's fries by comparison.\n\nAnd the service was almost laughably surly.

We were there to celebrate a birthday, and the five of us were seated in an upstairs corner.  The sake and beer we ordered came quickly - no complaints there. \n\nThen a busboy came by with a tray of tall glasses of ice cold water. He placed one down, and then the entire tray came down. The water spilled quickly over half the table and - above an apparently slanted floor or table, no less - the ice water spilled into my lap. \n\nI jumped up, and my friends immediately had their cloth napkins for me. Alas, no busboy. In fact, we never saw him again. No waiter either. She came around a couple minutes later, as I was still wiping down the chair with a cloth napkin that didn't collect water. She said, \"Oh, that won't do. You need a towel.\" You think??? I was in such a fluster, I didn't realize she thought we had spilled the water because she said, \"Oh, I thought you guys did it.\" Nice. \n\nAnd then? Nothing. I mean, seriously? Not a diva, but the waitresses were acting like nothing happened! It's very hard to believe this happens often and is tolerated. A second waitress came by to take our order and, when we complained, said she would speak to the manager. She returned and said a dessert would be comped. I don't care about free desserts. I can buy mochi for cheap at 99 Ranch and green tea ice cream anywhere. What really would've been wonderful would have been a visit by the manager and a customer service acknowledgement to the bday boy himself for starting his night off wrong. \n\nThe food started coming. We eat a lot of sushi. A LOT. I have had better nigiri elsewhere. My bf and I ordered only that, and from the specials side. We don't do rolls. If you like rolls, this place has potential. Our friends ordered a few, and they looked delicious.*\n\n*Except for the one roll I partook in. The halibut cooler appetizer barely held together. It was bland and, simply put, needed more \"fillers.\" \n\nNigiri-wise: \n\nJalapeno yellowtail: You can't go wrong. So many places do it, and in so many different ways. As long as you have fresh fish and a deft sushi hand, it's solid. This one passed. \n\nGinger bluefin tuna: Don't know. I ordered it and 15 minutes later, the waitress returned to tell me they were out of bluefin. \n\nSeared hotate: Warm, topped with nothing but a few sprinkles of chives. So, basically the taste of char. \n\nSeared kobe beef: So one of our favorites is an off-menu sushi item at Sushi Roku with wagyu beef. The meat is like butter under uni. If you didn't have teeth, you wouldn't need them. I know it's not fair to compare, but Arigato's kobe was so subpar...it was \"cooked\" thoroughly to a medium (no red!) and was so hard to chew. Like a piece of beef in a beef\/broccoli Chinese dish. \n\nWe were still hungry, but we gave up. \n\nOur ravenous uptake of Mad Dogs a little later was a scene to behold.","date":"2012-12-06 18:06:09","vector":[0.100352,0.2394666667,0.0,0.0018545455,0.0]}

As I walked in I was full of hope, hope that the wraps provided would be as delicious, if not more than the previous occupants... I was blown away by how flavorful their food is! \nFirst of all I must say, their Chicken Shawarma wraps are out of this world! The chicken is layered on a vertical spit roast and slow roasted this way, creating the most tender, juicy meat ever. The seasonings and spices they use to flavor their meats make for some of the best Shawarma around town. Watching them cut the meat off with their electric knife is quite entertaining for a boring afternoon! \nThey add a garlic sauce and I ALWAYS ask for Tzatziki sauce too because well, who doesn't like a delicious cucumber yogurt sauce? Then I add all my must have toppings which for me are things like black olives, banana peppers, feta cheese, (their homemade cucumber relish is amazing by the way) so I get some of that too and I also always HAVE to get the pickled turnips! \nFunny Story: I recently went in and couldn't remember what they were called but just knew I wanted the pink pickled things!! One of the men was surprised that I knew this item was available, even though it wasn't on the line...(I am a regular...I know the goods!) he said, \"Oh you know our items!\"  Then another man said, \"If you can't remember just think...[as he pulled the turnips out of the cooler below and raised them up with a smile] TURN UP FOR WHAT!?\" ...HA! My friend and I were laughing so hard I could barely remember what else I wanted on my wrap! Of course there is always Tahini sauce! I can't help it, all these sauces with this meat and their pickled creations make for one, out of this world, masterpiece of a wrap!\nFinally, while I have visited this place a few times now, I still hadn't tried their Baklava...and I am kicking myself in the rear now for not getting some EVERY time I go! If Baklava is a dessert you enjoy, you MUST try theirs, a rich, sweet pastry made of layers of Filo filled with chopped nuts, (I assume some pistachios involved based on the color of the nuts on top) sweetened and held together with some kind of syrup or honey...It is a perfect ending to a perfect Mediterranean, Greek style meal and I don't think I'll visit again without getting some of it!","date":"2015-03-05 00:01:17","vector":[0.1510323529,0.0,0.0,0.15905,0.0]}

My family came to Jasper's at the end of my graduation weekend and the restaurant was very accommodating of our group of ten. We started out with some fun frozen drinks and appetizers. I had the \"cold fashioned\" which was delicious, such a fun take on a classic drink. My cousin had the frose and enjoyed it as well. We shared the caulipoppers, redrum roasted wings, and chorizo chili cheese fries. The fries were my personal favorite. My cousin had the lonestar cowboy chicken and I had the potsicker salad. We both really liked our entrees. The potsticker salad is packed with flavor and was filling and delicious! The chef was very accommodating of my cousin's peanut allergy and prepared all the dishes without peanuts. \n\nAfter our meals we tried all three desserts on the menu: a passionfruit cheesecake, a chocolate cake, and an ice cream sandwich. My favorite was the ice cream sandwich. It was a super unique flavor combination - strawberry sorbet and snickerdoodle. I was initially skeptical, but it ended up being my favorite one! The flavors went together so well.","date":"2021-05-20 20:26:52","vector":[0.1356157895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The food and the people are both incredible.  \n\nThe two items I've had so far are the massaman curry (my favorite Thai dish, and one of my favorite dishes period) and their specialty, the pork belly stew.  While I intend to sample more of the menu in future visits, I think I could eat either of those dishes here regularly and never tire of them.  I can't speak to standards like Pad Thai or Kao Pad, but you can find those dishes well prepared anywhere.  So I'm sure they're great here, too.  Everything is so freshly prepared, the flavors are bright and balanced, and the texture and consistency are perfect.  \n\nThey offer the usual flavor\/spice guide of mild\/medium\/hot\/Thai hot.  Since massaman curry usually doesn't have much heat on its own, I ordered it Thai hot.  What a treat!  It was perfect.  I've had massaman curry at Thai restaurants all over the country, and it was as good as I've had anywhere.  I've never been to Thailand, so I can't say how it compares with the real deal, but by American standards, it's the best.\n\nOn my first visit, the owner (I presume) recommended that I try their pork belly stew the next time in.  So I did, and I was blown away.  It's more of a soup, with a magnificent pork and ginger broth, pork belly, tofu and a couple hard boiled eggs.  It may sound like an odd combo, but it's one of the best meals I've had all year.  I put the accompanying rice right in the bowl with the soup.  They only serve it mild, but they'll bring you dried red pepper to spice it up a bit, which I did.  Honestly it didn't need the pepper.  I normally don't care for the consistency and texture of tofu, but I honestly wouldn't have known that's what I was eating if I hadn't read it on the menu.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is modestly sized, but not small or cramped.  It's very modern and impeccably clean.  As nice as this place is, and as great as their food is, the people who run it are the true highlight.  Everyone is so incredibly friendly, you just can't help but feel welcome and happy when you're there.  It just warms my heart to see folks like that who have immigrated from other countries taking their shot at the American dream. \n I would be shocked to hear of anyone who enjoys Thai food (or at least the Americanized version we mostly get here) not loving this place.","date":"2018-08-25 22:27:51","vector":[0.2232461538,0.1806,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I've dined-in a few times but more often I call ahead of time and place an order for pick-up - usually it's ready in 10-15 minutes, depending on how big my order is.\nIf you're planning on eating there during a weekday noon hour, I strongly recommend making reservations. It really packs in. \nI really like their bento boxes. For $10.50, you get a basic salad, two pieces of maki (usually shrimp tempura, with avocado and tobiko - I love that they don't give you a crappy roll like cucumber), a huge mound of rice, your choice of chicken (lots of lightly breaded boneless dark meat with teriyaki sauce, yum) or beef (stir-fried with ginger and bean sprouts, also yum), and then either sushi, tempura, or sashimi. I always get it with sashimi, and you get 4 nice-sized pieces, 2 of salmon and 2 of tuna, always fresh and the right texture. I think that if you dine-in, they give you a miso soup, but not with takeout (not sure why, though maybe I just got a miso soup by accident last time).\nI've also had their chirashi bowl, which is a huge bowl of assorted sashimi on rice. Three pieces each of salmon and tuna, and then a piece of red snapper (I think), surf clam, octopus, sweet egg omelette, a mound of tobiko, some cucumber, and a delicious marinated shiitake mushroom (I'm looking at a picture I took of it... mmm). Not bad for $12.25 - everything was fresh as expected. \nTheir spicy tuna and chop chop maki were disappointing - really tiny rolls - I prefer the medium- (normal-) sized ones where you can see small chunks of the seafood in the middle, instead of it looking like a paste. Maybe the temaki is better but I find them a little pricey at $3.99 each.\nA few take-out visits ago, I was in the area near the end of my lunch hour and decided to pop in to see if they'd be able to make me a rainbow roll (to go) really quickly. I asked if they'd be able to do it within 10 minutes and they said no problem (the restaurant was sort of full but I think it was mostly diners who were finishing up). They handed me the roll in about 3 minutes! I was so impressed. Unfortunately the roll itself was mediocre. The salmon and avocado seemed like it had been sitting out for a little bit as the salmon wasn't as fresh as all the other times, and the avocado seemed a little dried out. Nevertheless, I still like I Love Sushi a lot - it's a cute, reasonably-priced sushi joint and the quality is for the most part good (for Edmonton I mean). Would and will come back again.","date":"2011-07-06 15:08:06","vector":[0.0726285714,0.0,0.0,0.1947,0.0]}

We drove by it every day on our way back to the hotel, and never thought much of it. But after searching EVERYwhere for some blue crabs only to realize no one had any due to the hurricane right before we got there, we decided \"hey, why not give it a shot.\" So we walked in, and behold! A giant container of huge fresh, steamed blue crabs for only $1.29 each! Jackpot! I guess this asian owned restaurant had connections to some boat that no one else in the city had or something. We had just eaten, so we bought just half a dozen for the two of us and took it to the hotel room to eat. When we were done, we just sat there and stared at each other licking our lips. We just had to get more! So off we trekked to buy another half dozen. The people behind the counter were really nice. They picked the heaviest, biggest crabs for us. It was delicious!  Perfectly cooked with loads of juicy, plump crab meat, with just a hint of seasoning on the outside that doesn't overpower the sweetness of the crab. Only downside? They had no lemons.\n\nI can't say too much about the rest of the food. The food sitting on the boilers didn't look terribly appetizing. We tried some of their boiled shrimp. The seasoning was delicious, but you could tell the shrimp had been sitting there a little too long. I'm not surprised though. The location is too random to generate too much business. Plus, it's pretty ghetto. The area around it is pretty run down, complete with construction all over the place and abandoned hotels\/buildings. The next day, we were picking up more crabs when one of the workers stuck her head in from the front door and exclaimed with a mixture of humor and disbelief, \"They just stole our mop and bucket!\" \n\nLong story short, get the crabs, buy your own lemons, and eat your crabs elsewhere.","date":"2012-10-27 05:46:07","vector":[0.0616928571,0.0,0.0,0.1098636364,0.0]}

The specialty sandwiches speak for themselves- as all good food should. On occasion the delivery service can run a little late, but of all the times I've ordered, its only happened once. Many of the appetizers are basic corner store varieties that can be found anywhere in Philly, so I wouldn't recommend coming here just for the appetizers.

We went on a Saturday during dinner rush and the salad bar was just messy. Dressing was drizzled everywhere, toppings were in other toppings, just generally a mess. I know they can't control how people put food on their plate but they can certainly control on how often they wipe down the area. The salad was delicious as always because I love having the ability to make it how I want and it turns out great every time. But the soup is where it always gets me. I have tried countless soups here and they either have an extremely weird taste, like the broccoli cheese was just... Odd.. Almost like they used spoiled milk or something. Then they are either too salty, like tonight's choice of French onion soup. I took two sips and I couldn't eat it anymore. The only thing I can rely on here is the Mac and cheese. It's always hot, tasty, and constantly made fresh. I honestly wish I had the recipe. The clean up service is always great and drink choices are always great. It's over priced in my opinion but we still go on the occasional coupon in the mail. Even with the coupon it's still over priced for the caliber of food they serve, but it's okay every once in a while. With the coupon it was a little over 10 bucks per person.","date":"2013-10-13 03:13:13","vector":[0.1411714286,0.0,0.0,-0.07224,0.0]}

We go to BYOB's all the time and have never been charged a glass renting fee on top of a corking fee. Our total bill was around $50. The sign out front said if I check in on Yelp we would get 20% off our bill. We were then told 2 of us had to check in to get the discount. This didn't make sense to us but we obliged. When the bill came there was no discount added. We made the waitress aware of the issue. Lastly my friend and I split the bill on our credit cards. We signed our receipts and were on our way. I didn't realize until the following day when my card was declined while paying for lunch that I had been given someone else's credit card.  I promptly canceled my card not knowing who had it. I checked my bank account and noticed Smoke had charged the entire bill to my card as well as half the bill to my friends. I went back to Smoke where I met the owner (who was very nice) and explained to him the situation. He couldn't credit my card since it was canceled.

However I had a terrible and cheap feeling experience. Came here with a party of about 11-13 on Saturday night after dinner. Bc our party was rather large we had to break up in 2 sections to be accommodated, which was fine. We didn't have reservations. 3 things I absolutely hate about this place. 1st they only allow 2pp hookah. Everyone knows more than 2 ppl can smoke a large hookah pipe at a time \"eye roll\" but ok fine. 2nd, they charge $5.50 per glass to drink (a la BYOB) even if you ask for water and your not drinking liquor, super annoying! What if I drank out the bottle (jk) or brought my own cup, then what?! 3rd they make everyone pay something in ADDITION to a buying a glass. Therefore you have to either smoke hookah or \"donate\" a cigar to someone if you don't smoke. Paying to have a great time is one thing but to go to an establishment and feel like they are \"nickel and diming\" you is another. I get that you need to pay for your business to run (rental space, electric etc). But personally I feel there is an easier way to do this without annoying customers and giving off a cheap experience. Charge a cover fee at the door per person and get it over with (or maybe just on Saturday night). Or maybe just charge the ppl who aren't buying something. It was very irritating to have the waitress ask and count heads every second anyone (not even with our party) came to our section to make sure the numbers were right.

This Little Caesars was convenient and I had got a pizza there before and it was cheap and good.    I was going to go down the road to Joey's Pizza which is out of this world, but decided I didn't have time and would stop in here.    I pulled up to the drive through and asked for the smallest thin crust pizza they had.   The cashier said that the thin crust was only in the large, so I said I would take a large thin crust, 2 toppings and a large diet coke.   She rings me up and says that will be 11.00 and some change.  I give her a $20.00 then after a while the manager comes to the window and says that they are out of thin crust pizza dough until later.   I say okay fine I will take the 6 piece buffalo chicken wings with the large diet coke.    He comes back in a few minutes with the wings and hands me a two liter diet coke.  I ask him what is that for?    He says the difference in what I paid.     I then ask for a cup to drink it with.    He said they were out of cups.   I am frustrated and hungry and just about leave the parking lot.   I then decide to  come back in and stand in line to talk to them again as wings are 5.99 and I didn't want a 2 liter diet anyway.    I finally get to talk to the lady that started the process and she says \" I told him he needed to refund your money and ring you back up.\"   She then motions for him to come to the front and I tell him politely that I would like the difference back.    He ask if I want to the 2 liter and I say I will just keep it, but then I see that they have normal size drinks in the cooler.  I tell him I will take one of these and go get his two liter.    As I leave the store to retrieve the two liter he says I can just keep it.   At this point, I just want to return it whether or not he has to throw it away or not.    When I get back to the door, he hands me the check and my money back and takes the two liter out of my hands and shuts the door without saying anything.    Keep in mind, I had been polite the whole time.  I gave it one star because he gave my money back,    If he had said something as simple as I am sorry it didn't work today - please come back I would have let it pass.","date":"2014-04-25 03:27:44","vector":[0.01544,0.0,0.0,-0.0093818182,0.0]}

You can call it pie, pizza, or even a pile of poo with crust, but for its value, LC could have easily upped the price to $10 or even $15 for their HNRs. I rather buy 2 of the pizzas here at the same price as I can get 1 just up the street at the Pizza Hut (3 if you include taxes).

We were seated at a table right by the kitchen (I hate this, so it probably brought my review down one additional star just because, although I realize someone needs to sit at these tables).  Our waitress was pleasant but slower than molasses, and it took forever for our drinks to come, and salads were served with no silverware on the table.  Silverware came 5 minutes later, and one set had a dirty napkin.  We were only two minutes into eating our salads when two entrees were brought out, followed by two more a few minutes later, followed by our waitress coming up to apologize they were brought out so quickly and asking us if we wanted to send them back to the kitchen.  \n\nThe food itself was good - the steaks were cooked just as we asked them, and they have a nice choice of sides.  I got the 7 oz filet cooked just to my liking, and it had a great flavor.  My boyfriend got the NY Strip Steak with a sweet potato (which he didn't love due to the \"stringy texture\").  It's nice that you get a salad and a side with the meal, and there is more than enough food.\n\nOverall, had it not been for the service, Longhorn would have gotten a much better review.  All of the servers were more concerned with their personal dramas (we were in the middle of a tiff between two of the servers, complete with yelling), and everyone was generally distracted.  The Manager was visible; however, he spent half our meal standing behind us (by the kitchen), barking into his earpiece about who was supposed to be cleaning what table and \"Where is Omar?!\"  He did come around to all of the tables to introduce himself after the meal. \n\nI would bring Longhorn in under Outback for sure, but the food here was definitely a pleasant surprise.","date":"2009-05-25 14:19:53","vector":[0.1800117647,-0.17,-0.4404,-0.0519909091,0.0]}

They used to have a great inexpensive steak sandwhich but when they recently raised the price the quality went way down.  I have gotten it twice where it was mainly fat and grissle.  I admit that I do not expect the best steak sandwhich in pizza place staffed by mainly teenagers but still before it was at least worth the price.  The same is true of the pasta.  it used to be great but we have had it twice lately and it was so overcooked it was just mushy and tasted like dough.  However the worst experience we have had there happened tonight.  We had went online and downloaded a coupon for what they said was Pizza and Ribs x 2.  It was a coupon for two 14 inch two topping pizzas, a full slab of ribs and 2 and 1\/2 sides for $35.99.  When we called to place our delivery order the girl told us they did  not have a deal like that.  We explained we had gotten the coupon off their website.   The girl then put us on hold and came back to tell us they did not have that deal and ask which site we were on.  There are actually two one is cwpizza.com and the other is cecilwhitakers.com.  We were on the second but truthfully after playing around on both sites when you click on the creve coeur location you end up in the same spot.  The girl then told us that they did not have the special or coupon we wanted and would need to speak to a manager but no manager was there.  Anyway we were not happy,  she then put another girl on the phone who said the first girl was new and was not sure about the specials.  She again told us no such special or coupon exsisted.  She tried to tell us we were on the cwpizza.com site and not hers and must be looking at the one for Howdershell.  We told her no we were on the regular site we always use for their location and went so far as to read her the coupon.  She said she would have to bring it up on the computer.  (hmm wonder where that computer was).  She claimed she was on the site and their was only one link for coupons and that was the downloadable cecil whitakers link.  We told her there was a link right below that one for smokehouse coupons.  She insisted there was not.   (I might also mention only certain locations serve the stumpys bbq).  She wanted us to read her the coupon which we did twice and it said on the coupon valid at the St Peters, Ofallon, and Creve Coeur locations.   She still continued to give us trouble and put us on hold saying she needed to speak to her manager.   (hmmm the one who was not there).  She came back and again told us no such coupon exsisted.   So finally we asked to speak to the manager who they first said was not there.  She put a male on the line.  ( I suspect he was not the manger but just a coworker or cooK)  anyway.  He finally came on the line and agreed to take our order and we said we would give them the printed coupon.  When the delivery guy arrived we gave it to him and he said they had found it.   Now after giving us trouble for ten minutes if they did in fact find it the least they could have done is called and apologized.   Either way this was insane.  We had the coupon and instead of arguing they should have made the order and taken it and if there was a problem with their system they could fix it later but this is by far the worst customer service we have ever had.  Now between the food quality and the unproffessional attitudes of the staff it will be a long long time before we eat anything from here again!

When I called back to try to rectify this situation, I was told that the girl spoke with was new and unfamiliar with the menu, I was then passed to a manager, a man who offered to send me more ribs, but at the price difference. I didn't think this was fair, since I was misled as to what was what. after refusing at first, the gentleman agreed to send me more ribs at no extra charge.

Being a current out of towner, I wanted to check out someplace that was unique to the city instead of the more familiar (and let's face it, sometimes boring) eateries. But of all the independent downtown restaurants that boasted great reviews, I chose this one... For some reason. \n\nI think my first guess that this experience would be less than mediocre was the near empty environment, despite it being in the heart of downtown in the middle of lunchtime. Other than a couple of businessmen eating in a corner, it was totally empty despite the ample seating and large square footage. \n\nWhen I came up to the counter, the lady addressed me very quickly and rudely, as if they were in a huge rush and she just wanted to get it over with. Really? So I quickly just glance at the menu and order a burrito. We run through the line, and within 30 seconds my burrito was being placed in the hot press, which I thought was a nice touch and basically the only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of just one. The lady went into the back to replace some trays while the food was cooking and I noticed that another lady had come in, apparently a regular, and was chatting easily and friendly with the other guy who was working. What a contrast in experiences! \n\nAnyways, I ordered the burrito a la carte because, quite frankly, I was afraid to ask if chips and salsa cost anything extra. I ate my burrito in silence quickly, and later I felt nauseous. \n\nThe way that the employees treat the customer is the biggest factor in whether or not a person has a good experience with the business. If they treat the majority of their customers are treated like I was, then it's no wonder the place is in the state it is. That would be my main piece of advice to them.","date":"2015-10-03 23:43:38","vector":[0.0,0.20095,0.0,-0.00455,0.0]}

Both could have used a lot more seasoning. \n\nOur second experience was at the Food Truck Festival at the Meadowlands on June 2 2018, more than a year later. This time we tried the Buffalo Chicken and the Spinach and Mozzarella arancini. Again, both lacked seasoning and the spinach was totally missing any flavor whatsoever.

Check this menu of delicious trays they can make up for you: \n\nhttp:\/\/www.saveonfoods.com\/party-platters\n\nMy fiance and I decided to have a wedding in our home with just a few immediate family members. We were thinking trying to decide if after the ceremony we: took the group ( 9 plus ourselves) to a restaurant, or contacted a caterer, or prepared food ourselves. After finding out the costs of the first two choices ( yikes! ), and eliminating the last one because we wanted to free ourselves to enjoy the day, we decided to ask both Save-on Foods and Sobeys Delis for a menu of what they could make up for us in the way of party trays. Our local Sobeys was not able to create all the items on their brochure, including a couple that we wanted, so we went to the Ellerslie Road Save On to talk with the Deli counter manager, and found her SO helpful, even going back to bring out the different trays so we could judge the actual size that we were seeing in their brochure, and even giving us and estimate of how many people we could expect each to serve. We chose 2 Antipasto trays and one Mediterranean, as well as Desert and Rolls tray from the Bakery. These trays had better meats, cheeses and exras that we were looking for--- we wanted a more gourmet selection. \n\nARE WE EVER GLAD WE ORDERED FROM THIS STORE! \u00a0\n\nWe honestly have to say that the trays staff prepared for us for July 12\/15 looked BETTER than the brochure pictures. Our guests were asking which caterer we had engaged, and kept remarking on the quality assortment of fine finger foods. On our table, they looked fantastic. The cost was really reasonable considering the quality and amount of food we got, and we had a LOT left over. \nSo, in conclusion, I want to recommend Party Trays from this store, and want to thank the staff for their artistry in creating these delicious additions to our wedding that fed our guests perfectly. Hats off  to the Store and Deli Managers for providing customers with such high quality food items and helping make our wedding day SO perfect. We will continue to recommend Ellerslie Road Saveon Deli staff to our friends, and definitely will call on them again ourselves. :)","date":"2015-07-24 06:15:37","vector":[0.2701928571,0.0,0.0,0.20765,0.0]}

I also got to meet librarian Seale Paterson who was fantastic and told me about all of the \"ins and outs\" of this divine little library.\n\nThey hold monthly events such as \"meet the author\" every second Tuesday of the month, story time for kids every month and even drag queen story time when a drag queen comes in and reads stories to the kids and a lot of other activities. It all sounds like a lot of fun!\n\nThe library is small, but they have plenty of books for adults and children, movies, and computers. This is the main library for the International School of Louisiana, so don't be surprised if you stop in and run into a child or 30.\n\nMr. George is at the library every day, so if you happen to see him, tell him \"hi\" and he will be happy to chat with you and give you a little history of the library and the neighborhood as well.","date":"2017-09-15 17:24:54","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.5106,0.1668777778,0.0]}

I've never been to the St. Albert location, so unfortunately I can't compare the two, but if they are at all similar, I see why they are expanding! I didn't pay much attention to the decor, but the atmosphere was warm and inviting - mostly due to the amazing owner\/waiter, Danny. He was so helpful and kind, I'd go back for him alone! \n\nNow for the food! The restaurant has only been open for a few days, so I was expecting some small hitches, but everything went very smoothly and service\/food was prompt, which I think is stellar for such a new place. We ordered calamari to start and then I had the Pollo Parmigiano for my main. The calamari was delish - salty and crispy with 2 different sauces to dip it in...it was a huge portion and so good that we devoured it all.\n\nThe chicken parmesan was so good - flavorful and rich without being too overwhelming. I thought it was perfectly executed. It comes with your choice of pasta on the side, and I went for linguine with gigi sauce (a type of ros\u00e9). The pasta serving was HUGE. Also, I normally have to order an extra side of tomato sauce because I like my pasta saucy - but this did not need it at all. They mix sauce with the pasta and then add more on top. In fact, if you're not a huge sauce fan, I'd recommend asking for the sauce they serve on top to be on the side instead so that you can control the amount. It was perfect for me, but maybe not to everyone's taste. Also I'd recommend the tomato sauce over the gigi (both were delish, just tomato was slightly better). Everything was so good but the portions were so huge, I only ate about a third of my meal.\n\nThen the dessert (yes despite not finishing my meal I still had dessert...they're separate stomach's or something, right??) But guys...The tiramisu. Oh the tiramisu. I will be dreaming of it until I can eat it again. Every time I have tiramisu I wish I could have more marscapone....well this tiramisu is basically all the creamy goodness with only a small amount of lady fingers and it was Ah. Ma. Zing. Although possibly not to everyone's taste, I thought it was a dream.\n\nThe food was delicious and so affordable considering the portion sizes ($40 for 3 courses and a tea - appies and dessert split 4 ways). And the service was incredible. I definitely recommend checking this place out!","date":"2019-02-06 05:05:50","vector":[0.1469933333,0.0,0.0,0.06582,0.0]}

It's within walking distance of many places and downtown which also makes it very convenient.","date":"2018-07-29 23:53:40","vector":[0.0,0.2377,0.0,0.156225,0.0]}

Not the end of the world, but the fries didn't have seasoning on them.

That restaurant is called East.\n\nEast is an Asian restaurant that specializes in \"authentic, modern Chinese with a Malaysian twist\".  The review in Vue went on and on about how great this place is so I had to give  it a try last night.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant I was stuck at how wonderfully designed it is.  It has a modern design with a traditional flair.  The chairs and tables are very comfortable to sit in and eat at.  And it is totally spotless.  Spic and span clean.  Just a totally cool atmosphere.\n\nFirst I ordered a pot of ginger tea.  Man, is this stuff ever good!  Very tasty and highly addictive.  I found myself drinking cup after cup of this stuff.  And they use real ginger to make the tea, not some powdered concoction  because I opened the pot and saw sliced ginger roots at the bottom.  If you go to East, make sure you order the ginger tea.  And order it buy the pot, not by the cup(trust me on this one).\n\nAfter sizing up the menu I decided upon a vegetable stir fry titled, \"Melon Of Plenty\".  It's veggies cooked in a wok and included an interesting combination of things like king oyster, wood ear, shimeji mushrooms, sweet sugar peas, corn, carrots, wolf berries and lotus bulb.  Wow, just wow.  What a diverse taste sensation it was.  Not only the taste but the different textures of the food too.  I loved it all, especially the big, fat shimeji mushrooms.  It was hands down the best stir fry I ever had.\n\nNext I ordered \"Malaysian Style Cantonese Noodles\".  These included more veggies along with scallops, beef and shrimp.  It was kick ass in every way, and I especially liked slurping up those big, fat tasty noodles.\n\nTotal cost of everything(not including tip) was only $33 and the meal certainly filled me up.\n\nWhile I was eating the waitress noticed how much I enjoyed the ginger tea and gave me another refill without even asking.  And at the end of the meal a petite oriental lady came over to my table and introduced herself(I take it she was the owner).  As I shook her tiny hand she complimented me on try out trying out the unique dishes I ordered.\n\nSo here's what East offers:  a delicious, unique food experience, decent prices, a wonderful eating atmosphere and friendly, top notch customer service.\n\nSo fellow Yelpers, if you are craving an Asian food experience that is off the beaten path make sure you head north to East as your next port of call.","date":"2012-02-12 19:40:05","vector":[0.0953896552,0.0,0.1906333333,0.1341666667,0.0]}

Both north-siders, we opted for the convenience of EAST, a restaurant brought to you by the same group that owns Lazia and Wildflower Grill. I've been to East a couple of times before, both times happy with the dishes and the meal overall. Just about time I wrote about it is all.\n\nDishes are meant to be shared, Asian-style! All three visits, I've had the roti canai. It's a bit different from the roti you get at other Malaysian restaurants, such as Tropika. This one is a bit more flaky and... buttery? I can taste butter or margarine, which normally you don't. Portion sizes are pretty big for what you'd normally get as well. Their sauce is outstanding, yet not too spicy for the average palate. I could keep peeling layers of roti and eat a whole meal of it if you kept serving these to me.\n\nThe chicken satay came out looking stunning and with the sauce, they were great. I've been told that despite it's appearance, it's not as \"authentic\" tasting as the satay in traditional Malaysian cooking. My response: you're at a \"modern Chinese with a Malaysian twist\" restaurant... I don't think you should expect \"traditional\" or \"authentic\". But trust, the moist chicken is still a solid dish.\n\nMy favorite of the night, the beef rendang: braised beef in curry and coconut milk sauce. The sauce is somewhat similar to the roti canai sauce although richer and more flavorful in terms of spices. The beef was braised perfectly, nice and moist, meat falling off type bites. I wouldn't mind a bit more coconut milk to make it more creamy but we ordered the coconut rice to go with it which worked out fine. I've never actually had their regular rice before but I can imagine how tiresome this could get if the plain rice was dry.\n\nI forget what this dish is actually called, but it's a purple rice pudding. My guest was so looking forward to getting a bite of this, he completely forgot of my need to photograph dishes despite knowing me for years. Shame on you. Mixed with coconut milk and tapioca pearls, this bowl was serving piping hot (and I mean piping). This led to a discussion of how only Asian food comes out piping hot... never Caucasian. Is this true? I can't think of any hot Western dishes... Anyways, this was nice and surprisingly sweet, despite it's liquid-y gooey appearance and a great way to end the meal. Will have to order desserts more often here!\n\nOther dishes I've tried before on previous visits:\n\n - silver needle noodles (white wheat noodles with minced pork, fried shallots, mushrooms, dark soya, and egg): very unique! I've never tried anything like it and the texture of the noodles is interesting. It looks like clear worms... but it's pretty delicious. You might grow tired of the chewy texture by the end of the meal so be sure to order another dish alongside.\n- chicken curry: although moist, and flavorful, I didn't think too highly of the dish as my mom makes a similar yellow curry chicken at home. But the couple who told me originally about East when it first opened loved it!\n- laksa (not shown): Sharon told me this wasn't traditional at all and wasn't as good as getting laksa from other restaurants, which I agreed. Was mediocre.\n\nGreat place to grab some Asian food when you're a) on the north side of Edmonton, b) not in the mood for pho or Swiss donairs, c) like visual photos of all menu items or any combination of above! Service is superb, quick and very professional. Decor is modern and the restaurant is very clean. Will keep returning to try different menu items until I run out of things to try!","date":"2013-02-12 19:49:08","vector":[0.0873288136,0.6249,0.0,0.201375,0.0]}

GO NOW, enjoy this amazingly crafted food and bid adieu to this lovely BYOB.\n\nThanks to Michael M.'s review and notice that Gayle was to close, I quickly made a reservation and had dinner here last night.  I don't know why it took so long to finally eat here - and I truly regret not doing it sooner.\n\nI had the five course tasting menu (after it was recommended by a fellow diner)- and at $75 (yes - this place is on the pricier side) - it was worth every penny.  If the weather permits, sit in the back patio.\n\nService was attentive, so polite, engaging and knowledgeable - it was the cherry on our delicious dining sundae.  Because I made the culinary oversight of not eating here sooner, I thought it best to try out the tasting menu to really experience what the kitchen could do - I'm so glad that I did.  \n\nIt began with a goat cheese, pesto and beet amuse-bouche, bread hot from the oven with homemade garlicky butter.  First, a summery gazpacho, with two jumbo poached shrimp and a summer salad served on top.  Followed by a perfectly cooked slice ahi tuna on a bed of leek basmati herb rice, a side of tuna tartare and a curry ice cream.  Third course, came in the form of an expertly cooked beef tenderloin with fresh sweet corn fricass\u00e9, chanterelles, fingerling potatoes.  Fourth course, le fromage - a pungent stinky brie, baguette slice, cherries and leafy greens.  Our dinner came to a refreshing end with a summer soup (too many ingredients to list here!) along with brownie and angel macadamia cake bites.  In all, it was perfection and something I won't get the chance to experience again.\n\nSo go. Now. Before it's too late.  You won't regret it.","date":"2009-08-28 15:35:38","vector":[0.1173580645,0.0,0.2263,0.1140285714,0.0]}

I own a very good, but heavy, 40-year old full-sized accordion. I like it, but decided to look around for a newer (but still used) lighter-weight instrument. Prior to visiting Liberty, I spent quite a few hours shopping their website. They clearly put a lot of effort into their online store: for each instrument, Liberty includes an informative spec summary, along with a detailed video demo allowing you to see and hear each register stop, and listen to it being played as well. (Word of caution: In addition to the videos in their online store, you may also run across Liberty Bellows YouTube videos. Be aware that these are legacy videos of already-sold accordions. Don't make the mistake that these are all still available for sale!)\n\nThe staff at Liberty is great. They are very knowledge in everything-accordion. They are exceptionally patient and accommodating as well. I spent several hours in their store and they generously allowed me to take my time and play any instrument I wanted to try, and for as long as I wanted, with no pressure at all. The store is fairly small but it's wall-to-wall accordions, covering both new and used instruments over a wide price range. Their prices are good but, overall, not what I would consider outstanding. I purchased a moderately priced 37\/96 4\/4 used accordion from Liberty at a very good price. Liberty has a small repair shop in the rear of their store--a very important consideration--and they quickly installed a bellows chest pad for me in minutes   \n\nAs a point of comparison, I have purchased two used accordions from Castiglione Accordions in Michigan. I must say that Castiglione's pricing seems generally quite a bit better than Liberty's. So if you want the lowest price, you must give Castiglione's a look. On the flip side, Liberty's staff is much friendlier and outgoing than Castiglione's and they go out of their way to help. Castiglione's website contains an extensive library spreadsheet of used accordions, offering a much better selection than Liberty, but with no videos or demos--not even a photo!--meaning you must email or phone them for each instrument in their list you are interested in. \n\n....Lots of trade offs, but you can't go wrong buying from either place. Accordions are peculiar instruments and sales people in general music stores know nothing about them. Whatever you do, DO NOT buy a used accordion on eBay or from an internet seller unless you know a lot about accordion maintenance and repair, because it is impossible to determine the condition of an accordion without an expert.","date":"2018-02-16 18:40:20","vector":[0.0,0.0,-0.04,0.15801,0.0]}

A friend of mine and I were in town for the weekend and lucked out finding this place for breakfast.  This is because they have a great menu with many options, their food is wonderful, and their staff is about as attentive, polite, and professional as you can get.   \n\nIn my travels, breakfast places are always busy and this place was no exception but unlike most of the restaurants I have been to, the staff ensured that our wait for a table was very short.   Once seated, the table was clean, prepped, and ready for us to order.  Even during a short wait, the host kept an eye on the main floor and gave us an update as to how soon we would be seated.   If you visit this place and there is a queue.  Get in line, it is worth the short wait.\n\nThe menu was wonderful and I got exactly what I was in the mood for prepared exactly how I requested.  \n\nThe coffee was very good and there were always servers with fresh pots looking for anyone who might want a warmer.  From where I was sitting, I could see into the kitchen and smell the freshly made coffee as they put new pots on.  I love coffee and this was a bit of heaven for me.\n\nThe manager (owner?) checked on us to make sure we had what we needed and were happy.  This was on top of our server who kept an eye on us to make sure we had what we needed.  All this was done at the right level.\n\nWe liked it so much that we went back the very next day and had the same high quality of food, service, care, and attention.  This is unusual for me because I like to find things that are new when I am traveling.\n\nWhere I live, we have some great breakfast places but even so, I wish these guys were down the street from me. \n\nNext time I am in the great state of Indiana, I will stop back.","date":"2019-05-04 18:42:23","vector":[0.3879333333,0.2643833333,0.0,0.0760416667,0.0]}

But the fact is, my entree was inedible, and my boyfriend's was completely one dimensional.  After spending over $100, we actually left hungry.\n\nI broke my rule of never ordering the special pasta from a restaurant that I don't have confirmation actually knows how to do pasta right.  I wish I hadn't.  I have that rule for a reason.  After the appetizer was quite good and well-executed (the avo with crab) I thought I would be in the clear.  But even after I begged the waitress to bring me some parm, some salt, literally *anything* to make it taste like something other than boiled, crappy, cheap beef fat, I couldn't get it much of it down.  It was well-made fresh pasta that was completely ruined by a disgustingly fatty, under-seasoned sauce.  I'm not one to send things back, or make a fuss, but I regret not asking for my money back.  It was that extreme of a circumstance and while I didn't make a fuss, I had a hard time hiding my distaste for it from the waitress I fear.  \n\nMy boyfriend's coq au vin was not nearly up to our standards (though I admit, they are high for that dish).  It was a very minimal, Americanized version lacking in any complexity.  The richness that comes from really cooking the wine was lacking, as if it had been rushed.  Anyone who has a had a proper version of this dish knows it tastes like much more than just chicken cooked in wine when done right.

We left our Airbnb in the search for food and stumbled upon this little gem on the border of Marigny and Bywater. The restaurant is somewhat Gothic, dark and romantic with an intimate feel. We grabbed a seat at the bar and were greeted by Ajax, a friendly and experienced barkeep who earns a star all on his own. I ordered the grilled gulf shrimp (it is NOLA, after all), served on a bed of gnocci with a pork shank. The food was nothing less than spectacular, flavorful and complex. After we were finished, Ajax and a couple of Franklin regulars gave us a rundown of the best places to go in the French Quarter; this seems like a favorite haunt of the locals. \n\nMy only concern with The Franklin was price point. While the quality of the food definitely matched what I was paying, I also felt like the portion sizes were a little underwhelming. Being a big guy doesn't help, but if I'm paying northwards of $30, I like to leave the table feeling satisfied instead of wanting more. If eating until you're uncomfortable isn't a hobby of yours, however, bookmark The Franklin for a visit.","date":"2016-10-27 04:15:38","vector":[0.1090142857,0.4939,0.0,0.3129428571,0.0]}

My party of 9 (8 adults and 1 baby) were told there would be a 45 minute wait. The hostess asked twice if we would like to sit outside, but since it was pretty chilly and we had a baby, we declined and said we'd wait for an inside table. We waited 50 minutes before being told our table was ready...only to be taken to a booth that seats 4 comfortably and 6 squeezed in tight, where they wanted all 9 of us to squeeze into.  Surprised that she thought our entire party would fit into the small space, we told the hostess this seating wouldn't work (obviously). She was very curt, saying they don't usually have such large groups sit here, but since we refused to sit outside, this was our only choice. Again, I reiterated the fact that we had an infant with us, but she said then it was our choice to wait.\n\nNow, on any normal circumstance, I'd take our whole party and leave. I do not like rudeness or supporting a business who would rather shove their customers into a tight space without attempting to accommodate their needs...However, we were there with relatives who always rave about the place, so I didn't want to offend them by leaving. We went back and waited for another 35 minutes before being seated. At no time did anyone apologize for our wait or dissatisfaction. You'd think that displeasing such a large party, you'd want to make amends so the customer would return. \n\nOther than the incredibly rude hostess, the pizza was subpar and the bathrooms were filthy. The ingredients sound appealing on the menu, but their red sauce was bitter and the slopped on pesto overpowered anything else on the pizza. As someone who loves pizza, I was definitely disappointed.

Was a bigger fan of the Szechuan chicken because it wasn't as salty and had a touch of spice. \n\nSubstituted lo mien for rice and it was good, but let it soak in the sauce. Mmmmm. They're smart, keep lo me in flavors minimum so you can flavor it with your own sauce. \n\nGiving it five stars cause they delivered my food on a bike in sixteen degree weather and I was about two miles away. So yea, service was excellent. It does take about 30 mins to an hr though. But worth it.","date":"2015-02-23 02:11:45","vector":[0.1079714286,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I ordered a bowl and my son ordered a mucho burrito (their biggest size for $15 for just the burrito). Both meals were a joke! Unbelievably skimpy on every single ingredient- including the rice and all the toppings and even the sauces (he couldn't even taste the sauce on his burrito). On my bowl I was allowed only 4 toppings - each topping added was about a full table spoon full. One of my toppings I asked for grilled red peppers. I got two little strips (each about a pinky size) of cooked peppers. I could tell this wasn't gonna fill us up so I ordered chips and queso (the cheese queso was processed and tasted rancid- seriously the jar stuff at the supermarket is even better, I ended up just throwing that out. \n\nUntil this business stops cutting corners and cheating out customers I would stay away!","date":"2021-09-22 20:14:00","vector":[-0.0353833333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

You want great bacon on your pizza that can be handed to you right away? Go find this food truck. You want actually crispy thin crust instead of that chewy thick junk (I hate non-Chicago thick pizzas)? Go find this truck.\n\nPrice: $9 (this was at JB Blast, the website says $8 for the pizza) was a little high in my opinion, but I guess you pay extra for the top notch ingredients and fast service (worth it in my opinion).\n\nService: This was my first food truck experience, so since I didn't have to wait forever to get my food after ordering and since they accepted credit cards I didn't knock off any points. I knew what I wanted and Slice of the Hill gave me a great pizza in under 2 minutes (order, checkout, pizza in hand).\n\nNotes: please for the love of our hungry stomachs, know what you want before going to the window.

It's a really cute, classic place in the Hill that's a St. Louis staple, but in my opinion the food is nothing amazing.\n\nThe Amighetti's Special is their classic sandwich. It has ham, roast beef, Genoa salami, brick cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, pepperoncini, and special dressing. For $7.89 the whole size easily feeds two, but to me it's just a pretty typical cold cut deli-style sandwich with fixings. So although the location is cute and it's nice to support St. Louis institutions, if you're looking for a sandwich that will knock your socks off you should hit up Blues City Deli.","date":"2012-02-04 01:03:18","vector":[0.16305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Food is cooked and served by members of the church congregation and I have to admit that they are some very friendly people!\n\nThe prices are fair and the food is delicious, typically there are three main entrees and a soup each week that rotate however some items like the Gyro is available every week. There is also a large selection of several deserts ranging from Baklava, Walnut Cake, to Galatobouriko and Kataifi, of if you are feeling more traditional cheesecake is also available.\n\nOverall the Assumption Greek Orthodox Church is a bit of a hidden gem, and I highly recommend giving them a try.

UYE.\n\nLunch Friday with Brian M., Paul K., Ben S., Charleen S. and two of Ben's co-workers. A fun and lively group!\n\nFour of us got the blue-shirt memo: Brian M., Ben S., one of Ben's co-workers and me. Two got the yellow-shirt memo: Paul K. and one of Ben's co-workers.\n\nWe coulda been cheerleaders for the Rams, although that \"might\" have been a sorry display of agility.\n\nI got a small avgolemono soup ($3) and a gyro ($5) with extra tzatziki. (I've seen Kat V. get extra tzatziki, so I took a cue from her.)\n\nBen S. got me a generous plate of feta, so I avoided the feta Nazi. One of these times, I'm gonna put on my big-girl pants and get the feta myself.\n\nThat soup is so good. I do no like rice, but the rice in this soup took on the lovely flavor of the chicken broth and the chicken pieces with a pleasant tang of lemon. For a small, it is a generous portion.\n\nThe gyro -- while always good-sized -- got huge with the addition of the extra tzatziki and feta. A generous amount of succulent, tasty gyro meat, onions, tomato and tzatziki ensconced in a fresh, pillowy pita.\n\nWe got the same hilarious guy cleaning tables. He charges $10 for clearing, $10 for to-go vessels and $5 if you leave food on your plate. I told him to put it on my tab. He just laughed and said he doesn't run tabs. He may remember us from a previous visit. He's such a card! (No, he really doesn't charge; he's a joker, and he's funny. He knows who he can kid.)\n\nI ate probably one-third of the gyro and had the rest for dinner.\n\nNext Friday is shish kabobs over rice, baked fish with mixed vegetables, moussaka and more. Get the 411 at: http:\/\/assumptiongoc.org\/friday-lunch\n\nEvery worker here is a volunteer. The people who prepare the dishes, those who serve through the cafeteria line, those who clear the tables. It's an amazing operation.\n\nAnd it all supports the church. Friday lunches are year-round, except for certain weekends when there is a Greek Festival. I think Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend are festival weekends.","date":"2015-08-08 14:22:57","vector":[0.0540333333,0.0,-0.0516,0.3606,0.0]}

It even extends to other churches during Lent and some even call it the \"cod squad\" in other places.  Call it by whatever name you want just please tell me where the others are located...although I may never go anywhere else for lunch on a Friday.\n\nThe concept is simple - older Greek folks making some of the most amazing Greek food you'll find in STL and selling it for a pittance.  What an amazing hidden gem!\n\nI opted for a plate lunch which included a fillet of baked fish topped with a myriad of chopped vegetables all atop a pile of rice.  Simply amazing.  The fish was cooked to perfection, the topping paired very well without overpowering the dish and the rice was a perfect accompaniment.\n\nThe wife decided on the hat trick for dessert but somehow deleted the one I was most interested in trying in lieu of something she took to go which I never saw again.  The baklava was better than any I've had in STL thus far - light pastry layers over nicely chopped nuts & honey with that extra little hint of rosewater to complete the flavor profile.  The second dessert consisted of a couple of cookies with a different not mixture on top - not my favorite but certainly nothing was left on the plate.The third one was a bag of cookies that the woman at the register said go great with coffee.  I'm not a coffee drinker so maybe that's why the woman deprived me of them in their entirety.\n\nThanks to the subset of Yelp Elites who turned me on to this place - Brian M, Kat V and Patt C.

I discovered it accidentally while cruising this area looking for something with decent coffee and Starbucks and Second Cup were not going to be acceptable, as I am really picky with coffee.\n\nSo I took a chance and pulled into this parking lot, with plenty of parking I may add.  \n\nThis place is fairly new you can tell, very clean and the decor is quite modern.\n\nI have now tried their cappuccino, mocha latte, coconut chai latte, and eggnog latte.  All were very tasty and they use a decent espresso base for their coffees.  You can drink the coffee there or take it to go.  There are lots of seats.  \n\nAlso, if you are a workaholic like me....there is a great free WIFI connection!  Wifi has become quite important to me in deciding which places I will actually sit down and eat - rather than to go, because I have to be able to be in touch with my staff and business associates at all times during the day.  So this was a bonus.\n\nAs for food, they have mainly things like sandwiches, muffins, soups, salads, a few other healthy type of things, so this is very refreshing for a person on the go who doesn't want to lower their standards to artery cloggers like McDonalds, Burger King, etc. \n\nFor breakfast I tried their Cranberry white chocolate scone, slightly heated up, it was very tasty and filling surprisingly.  Got me going for the morning.\n\nFor lunch I once tried their Grilled Cheese Supreme sandwich, also heated.  It was very tasty and filling.  I also tried their lentil salad and it was good too as the vegetables were very fresh and crispy.\n\nI haven't had anything there yet that I haven't enjoyed.  And I walk away not feeling like I put garbage in my body.\n\nThe prices are what you'd expect from this type of cafe, about $3.75 for medium latte\/chai.  $4.50 for a sandwich.  Nothing outrageous.  But then again quality always costs a tad more.  And if you compare places like I mentioned above - they are truly the rip off artists.\n\nAs for the service, I found it very decent, it is an all female staff that I saw so far, helpful ladies and seem to know their products.  \n\nThe only tiny beef that I have is that their debit machine asks for a \"tip amount\" when you pay.....but why would I leave a tip if I have to get up and get the food myself once it's been heated?  They don't serve it to your table, it is pretty much an \"order at the counter and wait\" type of deal, I don't agree with asking for a tip on the debit terminal in these places.  They already have a tip jar near the counter, so if people are paying cash, I am sure they will throw in their loose change at that time (I have the time before).  But I personally do not leave tips at places where I have to get my own food and bring it to my own table.   This is not a high end restaurant with full service.","date":"2011-12-01 07:13:25","vector":[0.0981952381,0.0,0.0191,0.08038,0.0]}

I had to put on footies over my shoes to go in because of the poo and smears of poo on floor. One kitten looked really sick and there was diarrhea in the litter box. I adopted one of the kittens who was 5 months old that was in that room. She was playful yet a bit thin. They had her for a month since July 27th. I should have put two and two together and not adopted but I didn't and adopted anyway. I spent all weekend with a kitten with diarrhea that progressively got worse. Her little hiney was swollen and raw. I was so worried about her getting dehydrated so I gave her fancy feast chicken broth to make sure she got plenty of fluids. Metro animal control knowingly aopted out this kitten as well as others who were very sick and needed medical care.  They did not inform me of any medical problems or have this kitten on some kind of medication for diarrhea. When I returned her on Monday after having a horrible experience, they tell me I can never adopt from there again. They did offer to have her looked at by their doctor, but I chose to return her instead not wanting to start off with a new baby who was sick.

They had been in there a couple days by the time we were able to rescue them.\n\nSo when we got there, they were disorganized but finally got our furry friends out. They were yelling at us the entire time because we were not following their leash laws. I cannot be sorry that we have extremely well trained dogs who never are restricted by a leash. I understand their view but they were extraordinarily rude to us. Not to mention, they had lost my dogs collar with a custom designed tag on it. They took 0 responsibility for losing it too, saying it was probably the police dept. when there is CLEARLY a collar type on her check-in paper for the place. It was around Christmas time, but on Christmas Day I realized my dog was sick and needed to see a vet. I took her the next day where I dished out all of my Christmas money for meds and the visit (after giving Metro hundreds of dollars for both dogs' release).\n\nI was already very unhappy with the whole situation. Then I go to my partner's house where he hands me an envelope from Metro. Note, his pup did not get one, only mine. When I open it, it contains papers telling the RISK of kennel cough! So they KNEW they gave it to my dog, failed to mention it at all to me at time of pick up when I could have treated it before my dog got very sick. The audacity of these people. I am livid with them. I do not know if they thought us and our dogs are scum because of how they got there so they did not treat them as well or what.

I went ahead and decided to take a peek inside.\n\nFirst thing you'll noticed is it's not large place but there is a good amount of candy in here.  I actually had a moment were I stopped being a twenty six year old adult and reverted to being a eight year old kid. I wanted to sample all of it! But I regained my composure and alas became a twenty six year old once again. \n\nThey also have candy as cheap as two cents! Yes, two pennies! \n\nThey had just about everything you were looking for if you like candy. The thing that impressed me the most was the 21custom colors of M&M's. It blew my fragile mind that there could be more than the standard M&M colors.\n\nAnd if you're a diabetic they do have sugar free candies and other varieties depending on your needs.  Plus they had just gotten there gourmet and organic candies in as well if you're feeling a bit fancy with your sweet tooth. \n\nIn addition, they do have an assortment of games, accessories and clothes available if you like representing your favorite candy.\n\nAlso when I went in the staff was really nice and willing to help out. Always a bonus!\n\nAll and all I really liked this place! I truly hope that this business stays put for a long time on the Loop. A great variety of candy, a nice staff  that's knowledgeable and good location are major pluses.

They were on time and everything went smoothly. The candy was delicious. The reason they got two stars is because I paid a lot of money to get the candy that I asked for. Instead, she brought hardly any of the candy I requested. She brought peach and orange gummy bears, but none of the ones I really wanted. I really wanted the pink grapefruit, watermelon and strawberry bc those flavors are most popular and I wanted everyone to try them. Plus they are all a pinkish color.

Therefore, I often find myself making impromptu stops at snowball stands all across the city.  Just this past Sunday, I was prompted to go to Piety Street snowballs to give them a try.\n\nThe wifey opted to try a side by side snowball whereby you get two flavors served side by side, as opposed to layered one on top another.  The ice had a failry smooth consistency and was somewhere in the \"middle of the road\" between coarse like shaved ice and velvety smooth.\n\nThe flavors she chose were raspberry rose hips on one side and lime mint on the other.  The raspberry rose hips were too subtle, but would probably be good for someone who is looking for a refreshing dessert that was very unobtrusive and leaves practically no syrup aftertaste.  However, the lime mint was a real treat.  The lime had just enough tartness to make your mouth pucker (my mouth is watering now just thinking about it) but the cool mint aftertaste is very subtle and helps subdue the tartness of the lime.  To me, this is a great spring \/ summer flavor.\n\nThe line on a Sunday afternoon was only 3-4 people deep and we were served in less than 5-6 minutes.\n\nAll in all this was a pretty good snowball.  Perhaps we;ll go back and sample a few more offerings.  If so, I'll be sure to update this review.","date":"2013-07-16 14:31:02","vector":[0.1417875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I am a little sad but mostly delighted that my top choice has changed. Piety Street Snoballs is UH-MAZING.\n\nWe tried the Almond Joy and Key Lime stuffed snoballs, the Vietnamese Coffee, and Hibiscus Pomegranate. The stuffed snoballs use chocolate or vanilla ice cream depending on the snoball, and they load it up. The Almond Joy had roasted almond slivers on top and whipped cream, and the Key Lime was topped with bits of candied ginger (!!!). I'm at a loss for words at how much the ginger pushed an already delicious snoball over the top. \n\nThe Vietnamese Coffee is just as good as everyone said it would be. Definitely go with the condensed milk topping on that one. \n\nMy husband was unfortunately disappointed with the hibiscus pomegranate - it lacked flavor and wasn't very sweet, just floral and tart. But really, 3 awesome flavors out of 4 ain't bad.\n\nGood ice, ridiculous amounts of syrup almost to the point of being a slushy.

Amy also told us that she had to go to her other job and wanted to give us our bill in the middle of our meal and when we asked what if we want to order coffee after our meal she asked \"so do you want coffee now?\" We said no but can another server just take care of us and bring us our check. She walks away with no response and brings our check. She was abrupt, rude, inattentive, and clearly in a rush.

Overall though, I don't think I'll be back.  \n\nThere are a lot of nice things about this place - there's plenty of comfy seating, and the menu is actually pretty diverse for a place that focuses on wine first and food second.  I've had the cheese plate, a couple of apps, and sandwiches on various trips, and each time the meals have been solid. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a lot about this place that rubs me the wrong way. Picking a mid-priced bottle of wine can be tricky for the non-expert.  The last time I went I chose a bottle, and the waitress said \"We don't have that one.  they had to rebottle it or something because it was messed up.  I'll give you a couple of minutes to find something else.\"  Maybe I'm overly fussy, but I thought it was weak she didn't suggest something similar off the menu to try.  I always feel a little adrift when picking from a wine menu and the help of an expert can go a long way in making me feel comfortable.  \n\nAt 10:40 (I checked) someone who was not our waitress (manager or owner I think) brought over our check and said \"we close at 11.\"  Okay fine.  Sort of tacky, but the dude has places to be I guess.  So we sat there and finished our wine and chatted and at 10:50 (I checked again) the guy is flipping off some of the rows of lights and sweeping etc., basically letting us know we needed to get the hell out of there.   Now, I get that you want to get home, and it's annoying when you've just got one table between you and freedom, but we're paying customers, and it you close at 11, shoo us out at 11 if you have to.  I work in a job where if somebody shows up at 8, and we close at 8, I put on my biggest smile and invite them into the store and try to make some money.  \n\nLastly, I thought it was lame the owner had a boo-hoo note scotch-taped inside all of the menus about how he had to charge $1 extra for anyone to use a credit card because the evil CC companies were charging him too much.  If you need to make more money, train your servers to suggest specials, or dessert, or *gasp* WINE.  There are a million ways to make an extra buck per customer that don't involve a gauche note in the menu.  \n\nMy verdict:  Good food, good wine selection, but at times very shaky service and management.  I'll spend my leisure dollars elsewhere.","date":"2013-06-02 19:48:44","vector":[0.21825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Nashville has, historically, been a little lacking in really good, authentic Asian spots.  This has been improving lately, and Shabu Shabu is a particularly great example.\n\nOther reviewers have covered the experience, but you arrive and a cute robot takes you to your table. They have various setups (bar seating, booths, tables -- some more private some more in the center of the action). We had a baby with us, and they quickly brought us a high chair. You pick between hot pot, grill or both hot pot and grill -- we did both, and it was worth it -- the two cooking styles are complementary and both a lot of fun.\n\nOne big perk is that, for hot pot, each person gets their own pot and own choice of broth, which works well for groups. They have really nice burners and grills, without much smoke.\n\nThe food was great. They had an ample selection of meats, a ton of great seafood (blue crab, mussels, clams, fish, two kinds of shrimp, etc.) and meat, including thin-sliced beef, chicken and lamb for hot pot, as well as thicker slices of short rib, pork belly, etc. for the grill.\n\nAll of the food was chilled, and very fresh, which is important! They also have a huge selection of sauces, fish balls, vegetables, noodles, etc. Many of the vegetables and noodles are available on the conveyor belt, which goes around the entire restaurant.\n\nThe service was good, the interior was really nice and we had a great time. The price seemed a little high at first, but after having the experience and seeing everything we got, and the quality of it, it's totally worth it.

There are several variations of hotpot restaurants as in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. When you find one that mentions \"shabu-shabu\" it will usually be Japanese or Taiwanese style. A Korean style of hotpot will probably be called \"jeongol\". Chinese would be \"huoguo\" and Vietnamese would be \"lau\".\n\nSo far I have had the opportunity to eat AYCE hotpot in Denver and Aurora, Colorado, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Atlanta, and now Nashville too. Of all those hotpot restaurants this is the only one of them that also offers grilling at your table. This gives the advantage of three options 1) just the hotpot option 2) just the grilling option 3) both the hotpot and grilling options. Of course, we decided to do the dual.\n\nThe first thing you need to decide if you're going for the hotpot is to decide which of their broths you want to have your food boiled in. You also have the option to split your hotpot bowl, meaning that there is a metal wall in the middle of the bowl effectively making it two bowls so that you can, of course, have two different broths. Have your server explain to you what each broth is if you don't know what they are. \n\nI decided on the curry and the tonkatsu (pork) broths and the two play well together. My friend went for their miso. \n\nMost of the food you will get from the buffet line. There is a moving food belt that snakes its way around all the restaurant's tables. On this line is primarily the various types of noodles and some veggies to choose from. It can take some time for items to come to you, so don't be afraid to ask for something you don't see coming your way for a while. \n\nIf you want rice, you need to ask your waitperson for some. They are offering a bowl of nice jasmine rice. What I did was ask for a bowl of rice and also an empty bowl (same size). This way I can have a soup bowl for the broth. After I boil the veggies, noodles and meat, I put them in the once empty bowl and scoop out the broth and put in the bowl too. The trick is to enjoy the broth, so slurp it down! They will refill it if need be. \n\nIt might take them a few minutes before they can get your hotpot broth ready, so just head on up to the buffet and start choosing the items you want to cook up. There is quite an array to choose from.\n\nDon't be afraid to try some of their very tasty seafood\/tofu balls for the hotpot. There was both chicken and pork gyoza available that grill up very nicely. (Don't forget to get a sauce for them!) The selection of meats and seafood wasn't as extensive as it could be, but it was still very nice. What was lacking was crab and pork however there was some thick pork belly. The shrimp they had that night were large, plump, and boiled up perfectly. \n\nI do not eat beef, but there is so much to choose from that it don't matter here. They do however have shaved lamb and it is great both grilled and boiled. Also there is a separate buffet table for the various sauces to use during grilling and\/or boiling, or as a dip. You will also find a small selection of sushi. \n\nI read some of the previous reviews about the place being too hot and the service too slow. There was no problem with the AC and service was about as fast as one should expect, this on August 31st, 2021.\n\nCome here hungry and be adventurous! This place is well worth checking out. I can't wait to eat there again, but I live about 200 miles from there.","date":"2021-09-01 08:08:40","vector":[0.034545,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

She rolled her eyes when we mentioned that last two times we sat at the booth since we have a toddler and cannot sit on a bar stool.

My husband had two empanadas (I ate half of one and had a bite of the other.) I had an arepa de paballon.  Paballon is the national dish of Venezuela which consists of shredded beef flavored with sofrito which is a sauce of tomato, onion and green pepper; black beans and rice and fried sweet platanos.  While the restaurant does offer a meal of Paballon, I had mine in arepa form.  Arepas are white corn meal corncakes, thicker than tortillas.

They were deep fried white cornmeal and had a sweet taste to them.  The fillings wonderful.  \n\nI cannot wait to go back and have one of the meals.   Moreover, I saw tequenos on the menu.  Tequenos are white cheese covered in a dough and deep fried.  I used to eat these at school for breakfast and they were so yummy.

One is that it was cold enough in the restaurant that I had to leave my coat on for the entire meal.  I was dressed in jeans, boots and a polar fleece sweatshirt and I still had to leave my coat on.  The second is that the waitress charged a different amount to our card than was on our bill.  The bill we received was correct, and then for some reason she charged us for a second arepa.  She \"fixed\" it by giving us the cash back rather than voiding the transaction and charging it correctly.

It took a GrubHub call center employee, and a spanish speaking GrubHub employee, and me two hours to figure out what was going on. (They couldn't find our address which is very close to the restaurant.) \n\nAfter waiting far too long, the confusion culminated in a yelling match over the phone with a kitchen employee who called me to tell me they couldn't find our house, there's no manager or anyone that could help me, and they wouldn't give me the driver's number. They said they didn't have a number for him even though in the last call with the same guy, he told me he'd call the driver to help him find my address. The call ended with me hanging up on the employee after he said, there is no order, he didn't know what I was talking about, and there was no one else I could talk to to help me.\n\nI was severely disappointed and frustrated especially since the restaurant has good reviews. The only redeeming thing that happened was that another employee, I believe a manager or possibly owner, called to apologize and offered to still deliver the food. Problem is, who knows what the state of the food was at that point... It was around 10:45pm and we ordered at about 8:20pm. He said this never happens and I'm glad no one else has dealt with this, from what I can tell. Unfortunately, this was our experience with this restaurant.

My big kid ate every bite of his fish and raved about it (he is not one to rave). My significant other and I each had a grilled pork sandwich. Very nicely done and a great deal for the price. My S.O. stated that it's not a creative game changer in the banh mi world, but makes for a great lunch option. The restaurant setting is confused. It is clean and minimalist in nature, but the vibe is odd. There were televisions behind the bar (they don't serve alcohol), and the news was on during our dinner.

The bridge is pet friendly for dogs on a leash and is also totally accessible for bikes, handicap scooters and wheelchairs. \n\nWhile on the paved trails they can be crowded on weekends but we found people to be courteous and friendly. Most the bikers will announce they are passing on the left when you are walking. You will also encounter strollers, hikers, skateboarders, rollerbladers and families with small children along the pathways. \n\nOne treat as we were crossing the bridge the General Jackson Steamboat that departs out of Opry Mills came down the river. People on the bridge and on the boat all waved at each other adding a \"Nashville Hospitality\" twist to the adventure. Even the Steamboat Captain came out from the helm and waved at the spectators blowing the steam horn to the delight of the kids. \n\nThis is a great and safe place to take the family for a leisure walk or to get in your daily workout.","date":"2016-11-10 05:39:31","vector":[0.2294,0.0,0.0,0.0823166667,0.0]}

I'll let you out of towners (or in-towner dunces like me) in on the secret. You take the exit to the water park off of Briley Parkway, park at Two Rivers park, near the skate park, and walk under the parkway. \n\nNow that we have our directions in order, I'll admit it's a very cool bridge. I believe the thing was started and finished within a year, so you have to give your dear old Nashvegas that. After you walk off the other side there are walkways for runners, bikers, and you're casual strollers. \n\nYou can still hear the highway, but the trees give off a nice fa\u00e7ade of a secluded wooded area. Check it out, it's something to see without all the tourists you'd get on the pedestrain bridge downtown.","date":"2008-11-29 22:40:37","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0634,0.0]}

There's a small outdoor patio (packed on the warm day we had dinner) and a large interior, with lots of TVs for watching sports.  It isn't at all formal, and is definitely a restaurant and not a pub. \n\nAs far as food goes, my dad couldn't stop raving about his Teriyaki Rice Bowl, and he cleaned his bowl out.  My husband got a chicken Caesar salad; it was pretty small for a dinner salad, but he liked the real pieces of bacon and cheese.  I thought I would try the fish tacos - they weren't terrible, but they were so boring and so tasteless.  I ordered them without the cilantro garnish, and they came full of cilantro anyway.  Our server asked if I wanted them remade, but I was too hungry to wait for a new meal.  The fish had no flavor, and the only thing I tasted was the chopped iceberg lettuce and the cilantro I wasn't able to pick out (YUCK).   Spiciness? Aioli? Taste? Bueller? \n\nState & Main isn't a bad option for an easy dinner out in the southwest, but don't go expecting to be blown away by great food.","date":"2015-08-25 21:29:29","vector":[0.065325,0.0,0.0,0.100475,0.0]}

Story time!! \n\nThis Chipotle opens up at 10:45AM and I had to meet my husband and bring him lunch by 11 at the base so at 10:22AM I placed an online order to be picked up at 10:45AM.  $31.90 got me three burritos, a kid's meal, and two soft drinks.  I arrived promptly right as they opened and headed inside. \n\nI check in with the cashier and they haven't even begun my order yet.  The cashier offered me \"a drink while I wait\" and I was like...\"um yeah 2 plz\"...and he gives me this look like I'm a freeloader so I added \"the two drinks that I paid for....in my mobile order\" and I guess he doesn't believe me because he goes over to look at my ticket and then begrudgingly hands me two cups.  \n\nFinally at 11:01 my order was ready and it was surprisingly all there and correct.  Unfortunately there were a few quality control issues with the food itself.  The tortillas were harder than a death-row inmate, ya'll.  I had to rip off the top and bottom of my tortilla just to be able to chew that bad boy up.  \n\nThey were also the smallest burritos I've ever encountered at a Chipotle.  Usually they are about the size of a newborn baby but these were the size of frozen gas station burritos.  The chicken had to have been from yesterday's batch because it was completely dried up and crunchy.  I'm guessing the steak was from yesterday as well cuz' it was completely grey with no brown on the outside and riddled with fat and gristle.  \n\nWhen people tell me they don't like Chipotle...I can only imagine that they have visited a location like this.  Chipotle can be much better than this!!!","date":"2017-04-12 01:30:08","vector":[-0.0166666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I got a strawberry-spinach-chicken salad and the country fried steak.\n\nThe salad: I'm pretty selective about my veggies so this kind of salad is one of the few I'll eat. It was pretty solid. The chicken retained a fair amount of moisture and wasn't dry and had good browning. Plenty of spinach and strawberries, maybe didn't need as much strawberry vinaigrette, but it was a good sweet and sour mix. Candied pecans would make this an awesome salad, but it's pretty good as it is. One problem was that the salad came out with the CFS, though I suppose with this much food it was nice to switch between heavy food and salad.\n\nThe CFS: country (chicken) fried steak is one of my comfort food go-to's. This one was fine but nothing special. I like my chicken fried steak with a good, assertive flavor. I think it could've used more salt and pepper in both the steak and gravy and more sausage flavor in the gravy. I got this with fries, green beans, and fried apples for sides. The fries were a range of soft\/chewy in the middle and crisp on the outside. They were rather variable, from not so great to I bet these are someone's favorite type but not quite mine (though still very acceptable for me). Flavor was a bit weak though. Green beans were the standard canned beans. Fried apples was kind of like apple pie filling, mmm. There are also 2 biscuits, which I'd say were just ok, but that's quite a bit of food altogether. So, I'd say you can get the fried apples for dessert even without the salad.","date":"2017-03-21 03:25:52","vector":[0.1239,0.0,0.17,0.0,0.0]}

Us both being winos and foodies, we couldn't pass the deal up and decided to try someplace new.  Last night around 8pm, we drove over to University, found the place, and went inside.  First glance it looked like some combination of a grocery store\/coffee shop\/bar\/pizza joint -- super bizarre.  There wasn't a hostess stand like a traditional restaurant, but a strange librarian style counter in the middle of the restaurant.  We walked up to the \"hostess\" and stated we were there for dinner, she then explained (in an extremely condescending manner) we were to review the menu and stand in line and order.  Umm, okay, so lunch counter style I suppose?? We ended up ordering the small Greek salad, Boscaiola pizza, glass of Pinot Noir (only had one) and craft beer.  We were then given a number and sat down at the coffee bar\/bar area and waited for our meal.  First up came the alcohol, which was called out by the bartender.  The wine was really delicious, although the pour appeared to be not quite a restaurant pour, and my roommate really enjoyed her beer.  One thing we noticed is for advertising as being a craft beer place, they only had six beers on tap.  Perhaps they change them frequently?  I'm not sure.  The Greek salad came out first and I am quite sure it was the best feta I have ever had in my life.  It was sooooo creamy and quite amazing.  A few minutes later out came our pizza (we were still working on the salad so it was fast service).  It had a perfect wood-fired charred crust, melted mozzarella cheese, and tons of toppings.  I would be lying to say it wasn't one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  \n\nFood aside, service at this place had to be the shittiest I've had in the University area.  Not once did an employee ask us how the food was and the bartender cared more about cleaning the espresso machine than making small-talk with patrons sitting at the bar.  At one point, a customer was waiting at the \"hostess stand\/checkout area\" to purchase beer and ended up leaving because the hostess was too busy at the pizza counter talking to other employees.  I know this is a \"hipster place\" but if it's also considering itself a restaurant, I expected restaurant-style customer service.  \n\nIf you're in the University area I definitely would recommend this place based on the food only, not the service.  Good thing you can take it to go.","date":"2013-08-04 14:52:16","vector":[0.1291409091,0.0,0.0,0.030725,0.0]}

Still a small market to the place with some nice items for sale--typical of what you might find in a market back East.  But now you can also just get a glass of wine, a pint, or a slice of pizza and chill as well.  I went on a Friday night and found no indoor seating.  But we did have the patio off the side (accessed near rear of store) to ourselves.  What a cute patio--I'm excited to see what it is like when all the vines enveloping it are covered in leaves and flowers.  Mind you, this is not a bar under any traditional sense.  It's more a meeting place where you could have a pint with friends before walking home with a tube of toothpaste.  Seriously.\nThere is a happy hour from 3-6pm--$1 off pints (so $3 instead of $4).  \nFrom 7-10pm, you can get your choice of beer (pint) and a slice of pizza for $6.  Not a bad deal for good beer and decent, foldable (NY'ers know what I mean!) pizza.\nBeer selection is excellent--don't expect to find Bud Light.  I had a delicious Green Flash Imperial IPA.  There was also a Vanilla Porter, standard Porter, standard Deschutes IPA and a couple others.  But be warned--these aren't always what are on tap.  In fact, you are unlikely to ever see this menu of brews again.  They keep things fresh by rotating in\/out different beers.  So wonderful!  \nI'll be back--I need to see that patio turn green and see what new beer selections they have to offer.\nBy the way, no smoking on the patios.","date":"2011-01-10 20:22:06","vector":[0.0990125,0.0,0.0,-0.0422857143,0.0]}

Oilers game was on the big screens and that was alright even though we lost. A DJ was on deck playing old school 90's rap which is dope if you're into that otherwise you'd be wondering what 93'Til Infinity is and who on earth is a Mistadobalina.\n\nOk so the breakdown goes like this: \n\nThe decor of this joint uses Japanese subway iconography which works just fine complete with real name locations. \nTokeo Station boasts a sushi menu supported with izakaya items like ika and chicken karaage, (fried squid and chicken). They also have fusion type dishes like Kamikaze Bites who according to my birthday pal was disappointingly bland. I tried a few and would have liked a bit more seasoning on them. The word 'Kamikaze' translates to 'divine wind' random fact. Yea, this dish bombed a bit so to speak. \nI had the Oiler roll which did not give 110%. It was filled with tempura shrimp, tobiko, avocado and mayonnaise and to be fair, I should have ordered a more traditional Japanese dish. I suspect the roll was sitting on the pass for far too long and by the time I got it, the supposedly crispy nori (seaweed) was soft and chewy not crispy and delightful. To drink I had several glasses of Japanese salaryman favourite Asahi beer which is always refreshing.\nService was friendly enough but our somewhat forgetful server repeatedly kept asking us what we ordered but later redeemed herself by arriving with a Burt Reynolds shot for my birthday pal so that was a nice touch after I asked if she could hook it up.\nNow, will I return? Hmmm... although I only tried a few dishes to review, I wasn't too blown away on the orders. I would give it another go and see how their izakaya fares. However, their price points are slightly high for simple dishes that didn't have that wow factor.\nIt's a young vibe up in here so if you have a big group wanting to start the night with izakaya offerings before hitting the club then give this bar a shot. It's fairly new and I'm sure they're still finding their way but I feel they have a lot to prove seeing as Tokeo Station is sharing their real estate with some well established joints up Rice Howard Way.\nKanpai!","date":"2019-12-18 07:08:27","vector":[0.0286142857,0.0,0.0,0.1204,0.0]}

Even if they painted to whole building corner to their color (black and red), it is easy to pass by without even seeing it. Located in the little strip-mall area (between the space where Recess use to be and the Bottle Shoppe liquor store) on on corner of College ave. and 49th Street, the entrance is facing the liquor store door on 49th Street. Once inside, you can access the dining room area or take the black light hallway leading you to the taproom (my personal go to). \n\nThe pizza and bread sticks are unique and delicious. Both bread sticks and pizza crust are covered with their garlic butter and it is always fresh! I particularly enjoy the Greek's Special with those crispy pepperoni on top. Food prices are very reasonable for the extreme quality of ingredients they use! They have a wide selection of beers on tap with their association with Quaff On! Brewery that offers great quality beers. They also have a selection of wine, which is always good with pizza :)! \n\nAs other reviews mentioned, the atmosphere and decoration of the taproom is great, friendly, and very intricate when you start looking around. They have a bunch of TVs for a fairly small area which will make this place the perfect spot when you want to watch various sports\/games at the same time. I also really appreciate the music they have on, but I do not no how they would handle this during high watched games.\n\nOverall, even though I often feel that Greek's pizzeria is my little hidden secret, I wish to see this place become more popular and crowded. It is the perfect addition to Sobro with a great bar and excellent food!","date":"2017-09-13 15:19:58","vector":[0.2241615385,0.0,0.0,0.1265,0.0]}

They have a nice selection of beer, wine for the non-beer drinkers, and a nice selection of specialty pizzas or build your own.  It's a hand tossed round style, and the crust has a light buttery, garlic flavor.  We had the Gourmet House Pizza which had a great flavor combination of  sauce, Spanish onions, black olives, feta cheese, and we subbed Italian sausage in place of meatballs.

Combine this with the 6 page patient info form, you get a strong sense that they want to know you and your lifestyle before the treatment. The second treatment with Eva also started out with some Q&A and she took my pulse on both wrists. They are friendly and ready to answer my questions about soreness in different areas and what that means in terms of meridians.\n\nI went in for seasonal allergies, upper back stiffness (from hunching over in front of a computer too long) and ankle soreness (old injury returning). In case you're wondering, the needles don't hurt. The sensation is somewhat similar to poking yourself lightly with a pen.\n\nHalf an hour later, I left feeling energized and improvement in all areas. It was a great touch to receive a quick massage and balm rub on my back after they removed the needles. For the second treatment, Eva used moxa on my ankle but I didn't feel much heat from it. I asked about my stomach meridian (3 fingers below the knees) soreness and after treatment this was the first time in a while that the soreness there is gone.\n\nThe space is just right. The community sessions means you'll be in an open area with up to 3 others getting treatment, as they rotate. One speaker plays soothing music and another speaker plays sounds of water flowing to help you relax.\n\nThe front desk folks are also friendly. They offer free tea while you wait (if you're early that is, both times they were very punctual in keeping the appointment) and a community bulletin board for locals to pin up flyers and business cards.\n\nExcellent people, treatment and system. Sliding scale is much appreciated. You'll want to bring exact change as sometimes they don't have change and will give you credit towards the next treatment.","date":"2013-05-19 18:25:11","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We were the only people in the place and the decor made for a great first impression.  Sat in the bar area with an awesome view of a courtyard outside the restaurant.  Nice comfortable chairs, a fully stocked gorgeous bars with 2 large yet unobtrusive televisions.  The bartender was our waiter and he was great.  Brought extra ice for our iced teas, stopped by to check on us often but not enough to be annoying.\n\nI had the special of the day, a 5 ounce \"filet\" with scallops and shrimp, my friend had the 10oz flatiron steak.  She loved hers, it was served with smashed potatoes and a corn salsa.  Mine was just ok.  I loved the sauces it came with and the vegetable of the day on the side, the green beans with roasted peppers and onions.  The steak, however, was a poor excuse for a filet.  It did NOT make me want to come and try their more expensive steaks for dinner, which was my original intention.  Overall though, for the price there are better options downtown including Mike Shannon's.\n\nTo top off our meal, when we went to pay we were told our \"Dining out Downtown\" gift cards weren't good.. \"Sorry\".  WTF.. that's why we came here!!  We'd already used part of one at another restaurant earlier in the week so the problem was not the card itself.  So instead of a $30 meal I was stuck with a $75 lunch tab.  Thanks a lot Shula's.  Good luck downtown .. I won't be back!\n\nETA: I did check with Dining out Downtown (DoD) and the problem was not with our card but with Shula's system.  I then called to let them know and the manager I spoke to had never even heard of the DoD program (uhhhh.. nice.. way to go training your people!) and took my name and number to \"look into it\".  Yeah, right.  Never heard back.  I made sure to fill out a comment form on their website and I sent an email to the director of the DoD program.  This is just ridiculous.\n\nETA2: After two phone calls and a complaint form filled out online, Shula's got back to me.  They offered to give me a refund if I'd give them my credit card number again over the phone (um.. no.. ).  Instead they pretty much insulted me by sending a $50 gift card.  Ok, so lunch there cost me $75 last time.. you want me to spend my time and money driving downtown.. to spend MORE money at your restaurant?  The managers here need some serious training on their customer service.  Before all this I might have been tempted to try them again to make sure I hadn't gone on an off day?  After this..

To celebrate our 3 year anniversary, we decided to go out for a nice steak dinner.  Since we live off Washington, we thought we'd check out either Prime 1000 or Shula's.  After a bit of discussion, we decided we should go \"off the beaten path\" a little and give Shula's a shot, having seen it from the beautiful Old Post Office Plaza during one of their many fun outdoor events.  As we walked in, a pleasant hostess greeted us, asked our name and promptly seated us in our preferred booth, explaining the history of the restaurant chain and Don Shula's career.  There were very few other patrons in the restaurant; however, our server, Charles, promptly greeted us by name, brought water to the table and explained the drink and food menu.  After deciding on a nice bottle of wine, we placed our order.  Our side salads arrived quickly, and were quite good.  After finishing, there was only a short delay in receiving out entrees; just long enough to not feel rushed, but to know they were being prepared fresh.  I ordered the cowboy steak, sides of seasonal veggies and a baked potato (by the way, every steak comes with 2 sides, so no a la cart here!).  Everything was wonderful!  I ordered my steak rare, and received it cooked to perfection.  The potato came loaded with sour cream, cheese, butter and bacon...delish!  And, the veggies were seasoned wonderfully.  Not overly salted like a lot of restaurants.  Oh, and the chocolate cake....oh man....  Since it's flour-less, it's more dense, like fudge, with a raspberry sauce, fresh raspberries, and whipped cream.  Absolutely wonderful.  Simply naming this \"chocolate cake\" on the menu was a bit deceiving, and quickly dismissed upon suggestion.  Charles knew better, and brought one out to show us as we were mulling over the decision to even continue gorging ourselves with food.  The second my girlfriends eyes crossed over the plate, I saw her head nodding \"yes please!\". \n\nThroughout our meal, we were regularly checked up on by Charles, the manager, and the hostess, who stopped by the table just to compliment us - we were dressed up to celebrate, and I have to say, my girlfriend was particularly adorable.  All in all, I don't believe we could have had a better dinner out!  Looking out the window at the amazing Old Post Office, and the accompanying Plaza, the tall office and residential buildings, I realized how much potential this pocket of downtown has.  Shula's is a bit ahead of the curve, but certainly adds to the area.  I hope the best for the restaurant, as well as the area.  We will certainly be back, for dinner or lunch! \n\n- Ambiance: modern, visually stunning, and comfortable\n- Food: great quality, cooked precisely as requested, and wonderfully presented\n- Service: top-notch, prompt, friendly, available without being intrusive","date":"2011-08-30 02:27:30","vector":[0.1467740741,0.0,0.0,0.220475,0.0]}

You can get a side salad or homemade chips as your side.  They also offer bakery goods too.  If you're looking to make a trip out of visiting the Frist (which of course you should) I highly recommend eating here before walking around the exhibits.  The food is very reasonably priced and it sets the mood for a good art viewing.","date":"2014-02-20 17:08:18","vector":[0.0658375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

When entering kid land there is a check in table with the rope you walk up to you. This I would say is one of my favorite things about this place. The host gives The child and the adult stamps that are invisible. This can only be seen under a black light. When leaving they use the blacklight to make sure the adult and the child have the same stamp. If they do not the child may not leave without adult. \n\nAs for their food they serve pizza and a salad bar. Well that's the only things I have purchased from them. The pizza is priced fairly reasonable. Their salad bar is very reasonable. However the pizza is not the greatest. When purchasing food or even if you do not purchase food you can purchase a child cup. This is another great thing about Chuck E. Cheese, you can bring your Chuck E. Cheese cup back and get drinks for your little one without purchasing a whole new cup! \n\nTheir games are excellent if you were on a budget. Every game in Chuck E cheese is usually one token. The kids can then get tickets or entertainment from each game. The only downfall is sometimes the machines go down and they either take your coins, don't give your tickets, or out of order. But I have rarely experienced this problem. \n\nThe staff there are very nice. If something goes wrong like one of the games took your token and you did not get a chance to experience the game they will give you a token to replace that token. \n\nThe only thing I have not experienced with Chuck E cheese is their birthday party packages.","date":"2016-01-07 23:45:42","vector":[0.0509777778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Not only was that all she got, but it took 40 minutes for us to even get helped at the prize counter because they had one teenager who was working both the prize counter, and the front register. There was no real line at the prize counter either. Kids kept walking up and cutting in front of us, and the guy would help them first. \nI definitely don't mind spending money when we go to places like this, but I do expect to get enough prizes for the money I pay.

And I don't mean on major streets like Hampton and Gravois.  But physically IN the neighborhood right next to houses. \n\nSuch is the case with the World Cafe.  It's situated on a quiet corner in the middle of this very quaint south city neighborhood.  I don't live super close, but it's definitely within walking distance.  Not having to get in my car to get a nice cup of coffee already gives the World Cafe a star before I even walk through the door.\n\nAnd what a great cup of coffee it is.  They use Northwest coffee here, which is a most excellent choice.  They've recently expanded their food and dessert selection as well.  To top it all off, there is no \"fancy coffeeshop tax\" here, everything is very fairly priced.  Oh and did I mention the plethora of literature they have to read here?  Or the board games?  And the fact that they have a mutha flippin Nintendo Wii setup as well?!  Bad...ass.\n\nOn the flipside, this place is quite small.  It really is about the size of someones large living room.  And being that it's not on a major street a lot of people probably don't know about it.  Which means that this place is a coffeeshop version of \"Cheers\".  I don't come here with enough frequency to be a regular, but the employees are always super nice and the other patrons will often say hi.  If you can tolerate the awkwardness of 10 individual heads snapping in your direction as soon as you walk in, you will find the atmosphere pleasant here.\n\nIf you like checking out random coffeehouses, do yourself a favor and at least come here once.

Taqueria Gonzalez serves up tasty tacos to order in a small sit-down restaurant. Service was fast when I was there.\n\nI went for lunch. The restaurant was less than half full. There's table service if you're dining in, otherwise, order at the counter for takeout.\n\nI tried the quesobirria, a taco barbacoa, and a pastor taco. They were all pretty good with homemade tortillas. They were on the small side and lighter on the meat than other local places, but 4 tacos definitely left me more than stuffed. The quesobirria tacos were full of melted cheese. I did not receive consomme with them, and maybe that was what felt missing. The green hot sauce was very mild, the red hot sauce was not as hot as at other local taquerias.\n\nI also had a cucumber and limon agua fresca. It was a little too sweet. There's only one size, and it rivals a Big Gulp in size.\n\nRight now, they only take cash.","date":"2021-12-06 18:37:53","vector":[0.0550166667,0.0,0.0,0.2202,0.0]}

I think the proprietors of Rhino (the same that brought you Fish) identified a \"gap\" in the food\/drink scene in Midtown Village - there was no place to come in and just chill. Not by yourself, and not with a group. Seems to me that Rhino is looking to fill this void, and I think they'll be successful!\n\nMenu features several shareable items, of which we sampled the brussel sprouts and roasted pork\/broccoli rabe\/provolone egg rolls. The brussel sprouts were SO SO good. You'd be dumb not to try them, even if you have some sort of aversion to brussel sprouts. Crispy, salty, and a little hot with the diced peppers mixed in. \n\nThe egg rolls were a very cool take on one of Philly's classic sandwiches. Delectably executed, and comes with some sort of dipping sauce that added an element of sweetness to blend with the incredible savor delivered by the pork, broccoli rabe, and melted provolone.\n\nBefore jumping to the next wave of food, let's talk about drinks. Happy hour. 4-7pm Monday through Friday. $2 canned beer. Get some. Nice selection and right prices = a must. Happy hour also applied to wine and mixed drinks, but I didn't think the special was anything too special, otherwise I'd have remembered what it was.\n\nOkay, back to the food... she got oysters (served all day everyday) and I had the wings, which came highly recommended. My first three were great! They felt more like ribs, which is different for chicken. But then they got a bit gritty, and I don't know why. Chatted about it with the bartender, who was awesome. She really adds a great vibe and identity behind the bar. \n\nOverall a great first experience. Place is new, so there will be some changes to the menu coming soon. Learned that they'll be expanding brunch options, although they currently have a breakfast sandwich available on weekends that sounded pretty good.\n\nRecommendations for this place: have games for people to play so you can draw a chill crowd, if any crowd, for hours post 10:30 pm and get TVs beyond the bar so people can come in for sports events.\n\nI'll be back.

It's a sort of counterculture in New Orleans in that it offers healthy food that might be best described as \"flexitarian\"; not 100% vegetarian but you can pretty much certainly eat there regardless of your diet. They don't have anything fried, and most of it is based around fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And most importantly, it's delicious.\n\nAmong my few sources of disappointment were my discovery that despite the fact that their breakfast is offered \"all day\", the thing I really wanted to order, pancakes, is only offered until 2:00, which is not all day. However, there was plenty else on the menu to try, and my \"chimi chimi\" bowl yielded a hearty quinoa-based salad with avocado and feta and pumpkin seeds. Plenty of substance. I also went for an almond-based smoothie. It took a while, and frankly they seemed a bit confused on the service end, but it delivered the full mix of sweet and nutty flavors I'd hoped for when it arrived.\n\nThe food is eclectic and not overly specific to New Orleans or any other culture, but frankly this place strikes me as the way I should be eating. The main reason I don't visit the other Daily Beets more is that the locations aren't that convenient to me, despite them being open seven days and for generous hours. This new shop is larger and easier to park near, and while it may stand out from the New Orleans food scene as compared to other areas where this sort of food is more common, I think I'd visit it again if it were anywhere in the world.","date":"2019-08-10 20:33:36","vector":[0.06766875,0.0,0.0,-0.08275,0.0]}

I had the pleasure of meeting both Chef Cristina Gonzalez (\"back of the house\") and her life and business partner, Elsa Cisneros (\"front of the house\"). Together as one they run this sustainable, local and organic-focused business. \n\nTo begin, both women are extremely talented and experienced. Chef Cristina attended the School of Culinary Arts at SBCC and then later worked under Wolfgang Puck and for Bon Appetit. On the other hand, Elsa focused on catering at Philip's College in San Antonio, later to find herself at Bon Appetit elbow-to-elbow with Cristina. \n\nNext, viewing the exterior of where Daily Greenz shared kitchen is located is unassuming. However, after entering you quickly realize that this is home to one of Santa Barbara's cleanest kitchens. Everything from the ovens to the pans were sparkling clean and new.\n\nDaily Greenz Pop-Up allowed me the opportunity to taste a few items. To begin, there was a refreshing Jamaica \"Blood\" Tea (for Halloween) and a perfectly-balanced Margarita. They provided a fresh Caesar Salad as a starter, followed by a choice of two tacos. The tacos included Achiote Chicken (refried beans, caramelized onion, cheese, and avocado-tomatillo drizzle) and Pork Chile Colorado (Pork Palace Heritage Pasture pork, refried beans, and queso fresco). Both tacos were small and bite size, yet huge and full of delicious flavors. Each ingredient could be tasted individually and enjoyed immensely.\n\nI learned and appreciate that Daily Greenz gives you the option to reserve your chef-created meal service between 48 hours to 2 weeks in advance. Not only that, they allow you to choose a flexible meal plan for lunches\/dinners (either or both) for one to every day of the week. Bottom line: If you are seeking a meal delivery service for your family, or a caterer for your business, please contact and give Daily Greenz a try.","date":"2020-11-04 04:14:41","vector":[0.0953952381,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Got a little messy and I needed a fork, but I ate every last bite. I wish the serving sizes were a bit larger for the price, but overall I would definitely try Nacho Mama again.","date":"2012-08-08 13:54:57","vector":[0.0077666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Served with salsa fresca.\n\nOne of the only foods I can successfully cook is chili. This is because chili is my favorite food. But when I go to eat chili, wherever I am, I usually don't crumble my crackers on top (unless I face a limited supply of crackers); I like to scoop the chili onto the crackers. Which is to say, I like to eat my chili, nacho-style. So really, what I love is nachos with chili on them, because this is the best combination of chili and eatability. Now, Nacho Mama's Food Truck does not serve chili, but I'm guessing you can guess what they do serve...\n\nNACHOS.\n\nAnd some other Mexican foods. But mostly NACHOS.\n\nActually, Nacho Mama's is the refurbished Indy Cheez Steak, this time manned by ladies doling out the nachoey goodness. It was no question that at the First Friday Food Truck Festival (May edition), I would be all about the NACHOS.\n\nThe Ultimate nachos were just that. Crunchy blue corn tortilla chips (always great for adding color and flavor to a dish o' nachos). Smooth and creamy cheese and sour cream. Black beans, which I always order on my nachos, and brown rice, which I never order, together forming the heartiness of the nachos, and leaving every chip piled high with toppins'. Fresh tomato and onion salsa that cooled the whole flavor in my mouth. Can you see where I'm going here? (I very much enjoyed my meal.) Basically, a well crafted, flavorful, interesting and colorful plate of nachos. Thumbs up.\n\nThe price was very reasonable on their whole menu, ranging around the $6-7 range. Their portion for the nachos was certainly generous, as I only meant to eat half but it was so good I ate it all and then I felt kind of unwell because I was full of nacho average nachos. See what I did with that?\n\nBecause every reviewer is really a critic trying to avoid feeling bad about criticizing, I will give you my feedback as nicely as possible!\n1. Styrofoam makes me want to cry. I know it's cheaper, but it's also spawn of the demon responsible for Ford Explorers and mercury in batteries. Recyclable, por favor?\n2. It was a little bit disorganized with the giving of the orders and the giving of the monies and the getting of the food and the getting of the change for the monies I gave... I'm sure that's a kink you will work out as the business moves along though. Or, was something different happening because it was Food Truck Fest?\n3. I will admit, this could totally be me off in my memory, or it could be that the Old National doesn't allow you to sell drinks. Either way, I don't remember what you do sell, but it would be great to have a Mexican Coke with your meals. Just a thought on food-drink pairings!\nBut really, thank you for an amazing nacho experience. It's my favorite food for a reason, and though it's not great walk-and-eat food, it was a great meal.","date":"2012-05-05 13:51:12","vector":[0.1229368421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

However, I had never tried their breakfasts. Gary (one of our \"dining trio\" that often includes my mother) and I were wondering what to do for breakfast. We decided to give Beyond Bread a shot, not expecting more than some pastries and some bread-y items. \n\nWere we wrong! We walked in, observing a full house of happily eating, noisy diners! They have a great breakfast menu, with egg sandwiches and about 5-6 choices of what else goes into 'em, plus omelettes, plus pastries...etc. A tough but yummy decision. Gary and I both opted for different egg sandwiches for around $6.25. What a GREAT choice!\n\nHe got a ham, cheese, egg and some other goodies sandwich while mine had bacon, cheese, egg, tomato and love in it. The most outstanding feature was the perfectly chewy texture of the slightly toasted bread. It was like...melt in your mouth terrific! And you get a fair share of food, too. On top of that, you get to choose from a few sides. I chose the potato pancakes (two good-sized ones accompanied the entree sandwich). I only wish they had some sour cream and apple sauce (traditional latkes Jewish style, ha ha) to put on it. I'm sure I could have asked but I was so full as it was.\n\nWe also ordered a sandwich to go.\n\nEverything was SO good. And what value! I had to take half the egg sandwich home, to enjoy for the next repast. I can't say the same about Gary's meal. His was inhaled, man-style. Good sign of how much he enjoyed his breakfast. I've never thought of BB for breakfast, but you better believe I'll be back soon!

It has to say something that 14 years later (eek!), we hit up Beyond Bread every. single. time. we're in Tucson. It's understood amongst my parents and sister that if any one of us is in Tucson or will be passing by on the I-10, they must call to obtain our bread order. Since we always stop at Beyond Bread right before heading home, this newer location at Ina and Oracle is our default.\n\nSo I obviously I think the bread is amazing. I have at least a couple loaves in my freezer at all times. I buy it sliced, keep it in zip-loc freezer bags, and pop it in the toaster or microwave as needed. I love trying out the special flavors of the day, but my go-to loaf is the multigrain. My dad lives for their rustic loaf, and my husband must always have the garlic italian for his sandwiches. If it's available, get the ancho chile loaf. It's tastes like a spicy cheez-it and goes great with avocado.\n\nBeyond Bread also has the best whole wheat pitas I've ever tasted. I'm so glad they finally started selling them direct. And unlike the pita bread at Trader Joe's, it can sit on the counter a few days without going moldy.\n\nFinally, let's discuss their banana bread. No other banana bread even comes close to their heavenly loaf. It's loaded with chunks of cream cheese (I don't know how they manage to bake those in without the cream cheese melting) and chocolate chips, and it's topped with an awesome cinnamon streusel. Every cliche about amazing food fits the description of their banana bread. If you don't like it, you're either allergic to bananas or too joyless to live (I stole that from Frank Bruni).","date":"2012-04-29 05:35:19","vector":[0.11682,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Forget craft beer, they're charging $12 for a 6 pack of pbr pounders and $17 for a 6 pack of Heineken? And with craft beer it's all $4-5 a bottle with 10% discount in a 6 pack. No one is going to pay $25 a 6 pack. If they don't start getting more competitive pricing (take a look at foodery) I'll never shop there and neither will anyone else.\n\nUnless you're talking about top notch beer, you should be able to get a decent 6 pack for $15 and a domestic one for $7-9.\n\nLet me know when the prices drop (or they close.

I am well aware that it is a busy holiday evening, however, I feel that this is not an excuse for the poor customer service I was just presented with by several \"managers\", up to a regional manager, when I called to see what they were interested in as far as reparations for an incomplete order that took an hour to get for carry-out.\n\nI will outline the facts.  You may draw your own conclusions:\n\n*  Order was placed at 6:27 pm per the receipt.  Nearly $38 for a large two-top and 2 orders of breadsticks with cheese sauce.\n*  My son was inside waiting for the order.\n*  I came back into the store at 7:24 pm and was told that they had been calling our order for                                              pick-up...unawares of my son who had been there the whole time waiting.\n*  Order arrived at home near 16th & Franklin and was found to be missing part of it.\n*  Having already been away from home for 11 hours this workday, I was offered by \"management\" to come back and have my breadsticks replaced.  It is approximately 7 miles from my home back to their location.  As you might have guessed, this is unacceptable.\n\nThe almost comical response by the management team is why this review is being posted.  I work very hard for my money, and to be this disrespected by a local eatery that I've shopped at for a number of years is simply inconceivable.  I will never spend my money in this location again.","date":"2016-01-01 01:26:40","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

It doesn't seem to matter where you are, the post office seems to evoke the exact same type of dread, offering a fairly consistent replicated experience.\n\nRarely, if ever, is there any ambience. There's no music to soothe your nerves. Generally, no interesting images on the wall to help pass the boredom of standing in line for 20 to 30 minutes. Nothing to alleviate the pain of what is clearly obvious: no one, seemingly not even the employees, wants to be there.\n\nI mean, bring a book.\n\nBut I do have some tips: \n\n1. I'm not kidding, bring a book. You may be standing in line for 30 to 40 minutes. That is not a joke.\n\n2. Prepackage your materials. You do not want to be spending nearly $10 on the box you could've bought at the nearby CVS for two bucks.\n\n3. Arrive early and get in line. On Saturdays, shop opens at 10 AM. It is not uncommon to find people waiting in line at 9:45, or earlier. Don't scoff at them thinking: These people have nothing better to do with their lives. Of course they do! And these are the insightful ones. They know that it's better to stand in line for 15 minutes before opening than to show up at 10:30 only to realize you're going to be stressing out your hamstrings for the next 40 minutes.\n\n4. Be sure to take care of all of your labeling, boxing and money before you reach the counter. Trust me, no one will be pleased whilst you fumble through your massive granny handbag, rifling around in search of a blank check to offer for payment (do people still take checks these days?).\n\n5. If you arrive at the counter realizing you weren't as prepared as you had originally thought (it happens to us all), step aside and let the next person in line have a go. Don't be a douchebag.\n\nAnd good luck.","date":"2014-09-20 18:02:05","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.126225,0.0]}

So I ventured out and tried to find some place I can eat (I'm Vegetarian) and I was so happy to have found this place.\n\nFast forward to October 2014, my friend George and I drove up to Reno for 2 days and we stayed real close to Great Full Gardens so we ate there quite a bit within 2 days. Let me just tell you how much I adore this place. First, off you know the place is good when its crowded and  you have to wait for a table, which wasn't a long wait....\n\nThe staff is super sweet with real great energy. Not pretentious or even pushy.... They know the menu and you can tell they enjoy working here! So kudos to the powers that be, they must be nice to work for and it shows!! Keep up the good work. \n\nAnyhow, if you are vegan or vegetarian you pretty much hit the gold mine in Reno here.. they have a really cool selection of vegan dishes (and of course non-veg dishes for the fearful meateaters). \n\nThey have a soup of the day and on Friday night was a Pumpkin, Sage and Hempseed soup. And let me tell you it was amazing! I had it with the Neatball sandwich an yummy take on the meatball sandwich vegan style. My friend George had a Reuben and we both shared a cauliflower Cerviche, which was partnered with some house chips. Let me tell you it was scrumptious! We also had the vegan lime coconut cheesecake, it was light and delicious.\n\nWe went for breakfast twice (Friday and Sat mornings) I had the Vegan Hash, which had the soy chorizo, potatoes and broccoli, spinach medley! Yum!!  George had the Huevos Pupusa, which he really liked, it was eggs over easy over a cheese pupusa with avocados and black beans, salsa and sour cream.  We both had the strawberry lemonade.\n\nOn Saturday morning George had the Vegan Hash, he just added black beans and mushrooms into his and I had the Juli's Breakfast Sautee, which included A saut\u00e9 of brown rice, spinach, cabbage, broccoli, white beans, avocado, cucumber, cilantro and lemon oil.  Divine! These kids know how to cater to my palate..... We topped it off with a Apple Chai cookie... \n\nSo I have to say my Reno trips might have to come more frequent now since I know where my dining option will be!!!  Great atmosphere, centrally located right off the downtown area in a cool little plaza with other cool shops and really super amazing staff... I hope this place sticks around for a long time... \n\nNote to self: Sign up for the greatful rewards card and get points and discounts. you can do it online before you visit the place and enjoy!  \n\nHere is to the the next time together!!

I'm sure that at times this place is fun. However, on the night I went, at least 4 people (including myself) had their wallets stolen out of purses and pockets, I am assuming while dancing. I first noticed my wallet was missing and went outside to begin calling my banks right away. My friend then checked her bag and noticed her stuff was missing too. While I was outside, at least two other people were saying the same thing happened to them. There happened to be police officers outside so we all took turns talking to them, although at that point there wasn't much they could do. Eventually the club closed while we were all still on our phones and as people were filing out, I really had to use the bathroom and wasn't sure how I was going to get home with no wallet, so I explained to the bouncers that the reason I stepped out was to use my phone because my wallet was stolen and could I please take a minute to use the bathroom. They refused. \n\nI know this was probably just bad luck - someone was clearly out on a mission to steal wallets that night. However, the atmosphere of the club was also just not that great. It was fun to dance with my friends but other people there were really aggressive. At one point a guy started dancing with me and grabbed my hand and licked my fingers. I kept having to tell people no and they didn't want to take no for an answer. It is possible that the people behaving this way were doing so to distract me so a friend could grab my wallet, or it could just be that's how people behave there - I'm not sure because I've only been once and I don't plan on going back anytime soon.","date":"2014-08-27 11:05:03","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We were staying at a local hotel and looking for a decent place to eat. Man are we glad we found Vincenzo's. Delicious, fresh tasting, reasonably priced. The service was attentive and very friendly. There were several 'regulars' there whom the staff called by name - that's a good sign. Salads _appeared_ dry but were dressed just right and very flavorful. Chicken Parmesan dinner entree was tender, juicy and full of flavor. Spaghetti Bolognese was just right - fresh and yummy. Linguine with White Clam Sauce rich and delicious.

The decor is a little outdated I would say, but that can be found with almost any Italian restaurant in this city, so it didn't phase me really. We were greeted promptly, and our drinks stayed full the entire time. We were given complimentary bread and olive oil\/parmesan. I do not eat grains, so I was limited to the chicken marsala with steamed broccoli and a side salad. The side salad was fantastic! However, the broccoli was very bland and the marsala sauce was extremely thin. The marsala sauce was also kind of a reddish color for whatever reason. The flavor was just ok.  I would have loved more grain free options to choose from but to be honest, I was kind of excited when I ordered the marsala- it just didn't deliver. I work nearby, so I am sure I will return and hopefully can improve my review then.","date":"2018-09-07 22:08:23","vector":[0.1198,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I was visiting New Orleans on business for a large conference at the convention center across the street, and craving a Shrimp PoBoy...OMG delish! \n\nNow...for the one star review...the WORST customer service I've ever experienced! We were seated and our waiter came over and said hello and filled our water and walked away...I saw him standing around talking to a female server off in the corner...25 minutes later, no one had come by our table..no drink order, food etc.  We finally grabbed the manager as he was walking by and asked to put in an order.  STILL our actual waiter did not come by for 15 more minutes.  Then 15 minutes later, the manager comes up and says \"I don't know what happened, but somehow your ticket got lost and wasn't entered (and my favorite part) 'but it wasn't my fault, I promise'\"  We asked him for our check then because we were in a rush to get back to our conference (and we had now been there for over an hour) we paid our check and STILL had not gotten our food.   When we finally did, the food was great.  I would have loved to have enjoyed it instead of rushing through it.  No one came by to check on us, or apologize for the mistake.  Frankly, if a restaurant forgets to put in an order for 50 minutes especially when it's the manager...they should comp the meal. That was absolutely ridiculous.  I stopped to talk to the manager on our way out and let him know our frustration and explain why there was no tip left..he replied \"sorry we missed the mark\".  Never again will I go back there, which is sad because they had some amazing crawfish mac n' cheese and crabcakes with fried green tomatoes.","date":"2014-03-17 21:06:55","vector":[0.0837,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

All smoky and cayenne peppery. The omelette itself was big and fluffy and slightly crispy about the edges, full of veggies but not waterlogged from tons of squash or tomato. I loved that they delivered a whole carafe of coffee. \nI'm not sure the food was worth the price tag, but it is attached to a hotel so it wasn't surprising. The slow was also strange, given how many people were working. \nAlso, just as an atmospheric note, they kept asking if I wanted a to-go cup for coffee.

The first is that not only do they serve their tasty food in their nice dining room but they also serve it in the Jazz Club upstairs.  The second secret is that this club is a very well ventilated cigar bar.  The third secret is that no one knows about this place yet.  The end result was that we received the full experience and enjoyed our victuals while sitting on plush relaxing lounge chairs.\n\nMaybe it helped that I started with two boutique bourbons off of their whiskey\/bourbon\/scotch list.  After this I ordered an under priced $12 Arturo Fuente Grand Reserve.  If you don't know what this is then you may not appreciate the full value of this place.  Doing things backwards as I normally do we ordered food after we were in full relaxation mode.  Being that the place was not busy, Sister Sara was more than amazing in her attentiveness.  \n\nWe started with the Caesar salad.  It was amazingly tasty, however, I will consider having only a single 1\/4 cut of a roma tomato weak on my scale.  The truth be told most Caesar salads don't come with any tomato.\n\nThe second share entree was the Orecchiette Con Tonno.  This delicious dish was shells with tuna, capers, white wine, olives and fresh tomatoes.  The tuna was fully cooked and I like it barely cooked but regardless it was a taste orgy.\n\nThe final shared entree for us was the Pollo Sorrentino.  We devoured this dish like it was newly found drugs at a crack house.  They coat the chicken with some flavor and texture that turned us into ravenous dogs.  The eggplant was great.  I seem to remember it had mushrooms on it but I don't see that on the menu and it has been a few days.  Regardless it was the best entree of the night and ended a great evening.\n\nOne more thing, this place isn't that expensive.  The food is definitely less expensive then the drinks.  I was quite impressed!","date":"2013-10-09 02:53:58","vector":[0.1508347826,0.0,0.0,0.3528666667,0.0]}

There are numerous reasons why I keep returning. First of all, I moved here from Bethesda, MD and had gone to the same stylist (my best friend, conveniently enough) for YEARS. I was nervous about going elsewhere. But I knew that going to a Paul Mitchell Salon was a safe bet. I trusted every single sytlist knew what they were doing...and I was right!\n\nI see Dillon. He has cut my hair, colored my hair and put in my tape extensions. He is always honest with me about what he thinks i should do with my hair but ALWAYS listens to my input as well and doesn't do anything that I'm not comfortable with. I can honestly say, every time I go to see him -- I feel ten times better! \n\nThis also goes for the salon itself. Every single person that works there ALWAYS acknowledges me, makes sure I'm doing well and are a joy to talk to. They make sure you are comfortable and well hydrated (they have numerous drinks to choose from - infused water, water, wine, etc...). When i go to get my hair done, I love feeling like i'm walking into a place full of friends as oppose to a place who is just taking my money. I truly trust every person here and always recommend my friends go to ANY stylist here because I am confident they'll have an amazing experience with whomever they see. Last time I was there, I ended up striking up a conversation with the woman sitting in the chair next to me and her stylist. Shocked me a little at first because I've never done that before but it's hard not to in this environment. \n\nLast but not least, my boyfriend began going to see Dillon. He is a wounded veteran who gets around in a wheelchair. He was originally nervous about going to a new hair place, especially a salon (he only went to barber shops before). EVERY single person made him feel welcomed there and happy to see him. He was given the same Paul Mitchell Experience as everyone else and he LOVED it (he might not be happy about me blasting his inner love for a hair salon now lol). Dillon gave him an awesome hair cut that was stylish but not too crazy for him to get used to. He loved it so much that he now considers Dillon his go-to guy and his hair stylist. Pretty impressive for a Marine who liked his simple barber shop short hair cut to want to grow his hair out now so that his stylist can do more \"stylish\" things with it. \n\nThank you Dillon and everyone at Mikel's! I am so happy I found this place!","date":"2014-06-05 18:14:20","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I took to yelp to find myself a great salon, since I never ever treat myself.  I called this morning and they fit me and my daughter in perfectly.  From the time I walked through the door to the time I left, I was a priority.  The attention to detail and professionalism of the staff is great.  Luis was outstanding, he really walked me through their processes there and understood completely when I said what I wanted, but would also defer to the stylists better judgement.  \n\nMy daughter who had never had a real salon experience joined me as I was enjoying a scalp massage and tea tree facial and went on her way to her Stylist, Jessica.  I had given her permission to get \"stripes\" (highlights).  Well, she got her stripes, HOT PINK!  And they look fabulous.  \n\nI always put value before price.  When you go to a salon for these types of services you can sometimes lose yourself in the \"price\" and lose touch with the \"value\".  Not only did I value the service, friend attitude and genuine smiles, but the \"price\" was beyond reasonable without cheapening the service and good work.\n\nI couldn't be happier, my daughter couldn't be happier.

This location has tried the soup\/salad\/healthy option before, so here's to better fortune for Sonoma Soup & Salad.  \n\nThis is a large, open space, with a small salad bar island on the right, and the hot soup bar up against the wall on the right.  The majority of the space is dominated with tables, and the back right has the counter where you pay.  \n\nThe salad bar is small, and everything is smaller containers, with some of them even split, containing two similar items.  I like the selection, which included everything from the standard salad bar options, edamame, cold salads (macaroni, crab, etc), and a decent mix of proteins (interestingly, the ham was in large, almost 1\" cubes).  The soups can be part of the all you can eat option or there's a per container pricing.  There were some interesting soup choices, with a black bean soup (looked like just black beans and water?), a cactus soup, etc.  I had the clam chowder and the chicken noodle.  The soups were a low point, with the clam chowder having a gritty\/grainy texture to it (like the flour hadn't been dissolved) and the chicken noodle was an interesting take on chicken noodle, with large chunks of tomatoes and a strong tomato flavor.\n\nThe highlight for me was the chicken curry they had on the side of the salad bar.  This was an interesting fusion, with the flavors based in a Japanese curry and went nicely over rice.  More a comfort kind of food than culinary genius.\n\nPricing is interesting, with a $12 all you can eat option, as well as pay by the weight option.  The by weight price is comparable to Whole Foods ($8.25 v. $7.99 I think?), which is a little hard to justify.  I'm okay with a premium price to support local (Sonoma is owned by local construction company owner Dennis Banks), but this is actually a pretty significant premium once you factor in the selection.  I'd guess Whole Foods has probably 3 to 5 times the selection of the small island.  That being said, Whole Foods soups are only available with a per container pricing.\n\nThe direct comparison would be would I rather have spent my $12 at Sonoma or Whole Foods.  When I do the Whole Foods salad bar, I usually end up spending from $10-12 on my plate, though I'm generally exercising restraint so as not to end up with a $20 bill.  Sonoma I was able to eat whatever I wanted, and not worry about it, though I generally got about the same amount of food.  I'm not a huge soup person, so the inclusion of soups at Sonoma (which were mediocre at best) isn't a huge plus.   On the other hand, my girlfriend some how had a less than $3 plate for lunch, and she was satisfied.  Not sure if she just wasn't hungry that day or what, but she had a decent plate of fruit and salad.\n\nHours here are weird too . . . 11 to 3, and closed on Sundays.  Almost seems like someone's hobby, and not a business trying to make money.\n\nSo, a little more expensive and a bit less selection for a locally owned salad bar.  If we're nearby, I think we'd stop by, but nothing stood out enough to make me crave it or seek it out.","date":"2014-08-12 03:08:24","vector":[0.1287358974,0.0,0.0593,-0.0128375,0.0]}

Very disappointed with the stay. The lobby was nice but the rooms had very old furniture and were not visually attractive. Flight arrived at 1:30am and found the shuttle to the hotel stopped at 10pm. Paid extra for the club floor because I knew I would be arriving very late and hotel page said the club floor had 24 hour snacks. After travelling all day, stopped by the club lounge looking for perhaps a banana or apple but found no food of any kind and all the restaurants were closed. The next morning I was in a hurry to make an appointment and counted on the club lounge for breakfast. When entering the club room I found the coffee machine out of order (coffee maker was broken in my room as well), absolutely no plates and all the food servers were empty except the eggs which were lukewarm. I found a bowl to put the eggs in but then found there was no silverware except a butter knife. I tried to eat scrambled eggs with a butter knife but left discouraged. The next morning again they were out of plates, and what little food there, was cold. Also, no silverware and coffee machine was still broken. I saw the only attendant in the club lounge rinsing off silverware (not running through dishwasher) and asked if he was bringing out more dishes. He seemed overwhelmed (the hotel was at full capacity) so I asked him if he had asked a manager for assistance. He said the managers \"always had their backs\". But I never saw any help arrive to assist this kid, nor did I ever see a manager check on the lounge. Bar opened late and was way understaffed. Check in staff were not sure if they had a credit card on file, and had other guests waiting in the lobby at 2am to check in because they had lost their reservation. Lots of other issues.

So let me begin...\n\nYou're sitting at the bar with a few girlfriends and you hear celebratory chatter to your right. \"What are they celebrating?\" you wonder to yourself. So as any normal person would, you turn your inquisitive head towards the chatter. Instead of a mutual feeling of happiness between the customers, there is a sudden display of hostility. All of a sudden, through the bliss of your $3 martini, you hear one of the grown men at the table- that was just celebrating seconds prior- start screaming curse words at you and your girlfriends for looking their direction. \"Is this real life!?\" you dumbfoundedly ask yourself.   \n\nWhat happens next calls into question Bernini's dedication to its patrons.....\n\n\nTo make a long story short, after the staff tried (unsuccessfully) to placate both sides, my girlfriends and I were left 10 feet away from the verbally aggressive party of six. They continued to curse and glare at us while we were sitting at the bar- much to the disgust and dismay of the other people sitting next to us; who couldn't believe that they were not asked to leave, especially when one of the young girls (most likely underage) started throwing up on the table....yes....on the table. Most places would ask you to leave solely based on that alone, but not Bernini's. The staff just acted like nothing had happened. When I went outside to leave, the manager had told me that he didn't ask them to leave because they were afraid of getting a bad Yelp review. So I asked him, if he were going to upset one party, wouldn't he rather upset the party who was cursing and most likely giving an underage girl alcohol (because no one checked her ID), than upset of-age women, who by the end of their experience, were afraid to walk past the group to get out of the restaurant. To those questions, he had no response. \n\nI understand in these days of instant access to information, that a place's reputation is all they have, but what happened today proved that Bernini's is only about their rating, and not about the satisfaction, nor safety, of all of their customers.","date":"2017-02-09 23:21:21","vector":[0.5719,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Instead of using the cheap stuff in the martini's, they use Findlandia vodka and it sure makes a difference when you decide to have just oooonnne more and you don't have a headache by the end of the night. They have lots of flavors to choose from but my favorite is the tangerine.\n\nIf you like Italian food, this is the place to go. My favorite favorite dish is the tortelloni carbonara. They make it with pistachios, broccolini, italian sausasge and pancetta (kinda tastes like bacon). All of this with a nice cream sauce. It's just delicious. Not the healthiest option but you can always hit the gym extra hard to make up for it. \n\nThe crispy duck, the carpaccio, all the salads and pizzas are all good choices. The only dish I'm not the biggest fan of is the chicken entree. You really have to order that one to take home because it's such a pain to eat if you want to look like you have any kind of manners.

He passed the test. \n\nThe history of the bridge can be found on Wikipedia here: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Huey_P._Long_Bridge_(Jefferson_Parish) which is quite detailed. The history of the making of the bridge seems as corrupt as the politics in Louisiana. I love how the design of the bridge, the way the railroad tracks start to rise by construction to make the pass of the bridge. It is totally understandable that they need more space to be able to rise up, and that the design has to be made differently than that of the roadway for the cars. I really like the aesthetics of it. This is not my favorite bridge, but it is fairly short and quick to cross, so this is not my most hated bridge.\n\nWith the exception of the train tracks in the middle, this bridge reminds me of the I-5 bridge that goes from Portland, OR to Vancouver, WA, which only a few people will catch. That is one bridge that really rattles my nerves, and has the same construction. It is not as tall.","date":"2017-04-16 23:15:52","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.151,0.0]}

I'm sure this bridge had the engineers scratching their heads back in 1935 while only using slide rulers and number two pencils to calculate the load ratings especially for the longest span at nearly 800 feet not to mention the fearless engineer who maneuvered the first freight train across this iconic structure.\n\nIn 2006, shortly after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the State of Louisiana embarked on an unprecedented project to widen this 75-year-old civil engineering marvel. The $1.2 billion project celebrated its grand opening in June 2013 with new lanes in each direction and major railroad modifications. The project was a symbol of resilience of this great state's people. It's not the same and that's somewhat saddens me but the refurbishment and upgrades will ensure this engineering landmark will remain for many more generations to come, but they'll never experience this bridge as some of us have...","date":"2016-11-25 01:24:59","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0257333333,0.0]}

So I thought if I went to a place that ONLY sold wings, they couldn't mess up the only thing they did if they wanted to stay open - and I was pretty right!\n\nThe wings here remind me a lot of my old college stomping grounds. The dry rubs are sweet and the sauces are creamy and heavy. A standard selection of flavors, plus some unique ones. \n\nThere is only a light dredge, if at all, on the wings before fry, which I appreciate. They're crispy right away but inevitably they start to get soggy sitting in front of you as you work through the pile. They were a little bit overcooked for my taste, but with the saucy flavors and dip you really don't notice unless you enjoy gnawing on the cartilage like me. Our food also took a while to come, so hopefully that means everything is made to order.\n\nThere is a dine-in special of $16.99, 20 wings and a side, and you can choose up to 4 flavors. And as for flavors, they're not really that spicy. The death wish, their 4 **** spiciest flavor, is really like a combination of ranch+buffalo+spices+heat, and while there is a kick, the name suggest something much worse than it is. I'd rather have it this way where you can actually enjoy your food - but if you eat spicy food regularly, I'd say this is perfectly manageable and my favorite one of the ones we had.\n\nThe riplets dry rub sounded interesting when I saw it - it was really like a sweet mesquite bbq chip rub. I probably wouldn't get it again. The ridiculous ranch, also not that spicy... Traditional hot was very thick and creamy and not as vinegary and tangy as I hoped, but does the job. \n\nAfter eating here, I don't think I'll crave wings for a very very long time - just can't go to town on them like I used to! I didn't even feel hungry at dinner after eating here for lunch.

This sounded so promising!  We had some value pack, 3 flavors, 30 wings, two sides, and two drinks.  We decided to eat there so we had a couple beers and sat down and waited forever.  Finally, we were the only patrons except one guy, the food comes out all wrapped up to go, I mean seriously, is that standard?  If someone buys beer and sits down isnt that clue that its not a to go order, plus we were vocal about it?  Maybe I am an ass an everything is wrapped up and tied presented to go, I have no idea, but if it is, thats stupid.\n\nWe got Hot, Mango Habernero, and Jerk.  The hot was not hot, the Mango wings were gross, and the jerk tasted like stuffing seasoning dumped on wings.  I had the mac and cheese bites, they were not good.\n\nNothing was good, service sucked big time, but they do have a ghost pepper wing challenge that looks great, and I think if we ever go there again, I would probably have to order the ghost pepper wings just to get some spice.

Despite the decent decor and reasonably priced food, I don't think I'll find myself returning.\n\nI was the only person at the bar, with only two other tables of guests in the restaurant.  There was no host at the front when I entered, but I was greeted promptly and sat myself at the bar.  While I wasn't drinking this particular evening, I did browse the cocktail list, and it was standard tropical fruit or coffee liqueur  based restaurant fare.  The menu is a decent size but relatively uninspired, classic American Italian dishes and a wide selection of pizzas.  I settled on the Tuscan Chicken Sandwich with a side salad, and was pleasantly surprised with the plump and juicy chicken breast and fresh bun.  My salad was pretty much crap, but the balsamic based dressing that came with it had a nice smoky flavor that I enjoyed.  Unfortunately, this is pretty much where I run out of positive things to say.\n\nThe staff at NoVi, including the chef who identified himself as the manager on duty, all had a bad tendency to crowd around the bar, talk or text on their cell phones, and pass around drink samples among each other as if I didn't exist.  To the bartender's credit, my water never went empty and my plate was whisked away immediately when I was finished despite the otherwise complete lack of attention or engagement.  \n\nUnfortunately, when I paid with cash for my meal I was flatly informed that the bar drawer had no change, and was given two large bills back along with a vaguely expectant stare.  Not being the type to stiff service staff, especially after 6 years in the industry myself, I ended up leaving a double the appropriate tip for my sandwich and water as i had no ones with me, and was gone as fast as my heels would carry me.

The zucchini strand pasta I had there made me run the other way whenever anyone suggested going there for food.  That was 2009.  This is 2012 and I have broken my vow - three times already.  \n\nIntending to walk in somewhere for brunch Mother's Day weekend, my family seriously miscalculated our chances of getting a table anywhere.  Constructively turned away from Day by Day, my dad ducked into Slate down the block.  No Dad! Don't do it, you don't know what you're asking for!  No wait for brunch? Damn.  Begrudgingly, I went in.  Hmm, the brunch menu looked surprisingly good, and affordable.  Interesting.  Still skeptical, I ordered a crab and bacon frittata and waited nervously.  The food took its time coming out (the place seemed very under-staffed), but I was shocked to find that the food was actually worth the wait.  My frittata was probably 9 inches in diameter and had plenty of good crab and bacon flavor.  It came with a nicely dressed side salad that barely squeezed itself on to the plate.  My parents wanted an order of eggs and sausage, which they don't have.  So the waitress had them order the two eggs and sides and the bangers and mash (you get both sausage and eggs).  Not exactly what my parents had in mind, but when it came out, it was more than enough food for 3 people and they actually loved it.  \n\nBecause of the great brunch experience, my fiance and I have gone back for dinner a couple times. The crab cake is big and meaty, enough for a very light dinner.  The mussels are delicious and brothy, with the bits of chorizo on top (also big enough for a light dinner).  Their salmon entree is perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and cooked to order, accompanied by a decadently rich mash.  We also enjoyed their fish special one week, tilapia filet in a wine sauce topped with shrimp and scallops - lots of shrimp and scallops.  \n\nMy only criticism of this place is the wait.  It can take a little longer than other restaurants for the kitchen to churn out the food.  The waitress said they have a very small kitchen, so maybe it can't be remedied with more waitstaff.  We also weren't fans of the old fashioned that we ordered.  There was a lot of pummeled fruit in the glass, rye, and not much of anything else - not your typical old fashioned recipe.  But overall, I am a new convert when it comes to Slate.  Their food is reasonably priced, perfectly cooked, and delicious.  And the zucchini strand pasta is nowhere to be found.","date":"2012-06-27 18:54:58","vector":[0.1090636364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I set out on a quest. A very lazy quest mind you because I didn't want to get too far from my house.

I refused to use my Yelp app or map on my phone. I would go blind into grave danger to find such a place. Would railroad tracks stop me, I say nay!\n\nOnce I came to Franklin, I knew there were places down there with food. Even if I gave up on the Chinese quest, I could get something. I saw The Red Apple. This place looked like a fast food type of joint, so I proceeded with caution. Their menu was mind boggling, but I had to try my best. I stuck with what I know, and order of General Chicken. The wait seemed long, but I know that was the hang over speaking. The total was $7.00... $7.00 for a monster mound of food. Then I think to myself, \"This has to taste awful!\"\n\nI finally conclude my quest by getting home. Now it was time to get my spoils. The food was delicious. It did not taste like fast food Chinese at all. If you live out in Bywater area, this is your best option. I've been there 3 times and I've yet to be disappointed.\n\nAlso, is it sad if I want to eat here and have a few drinks while playing video poker.

Upon arriving Phoenix went out to meet the shuttle and was told there was no room and I would have to wait for the next one.  When the next one arrived was told that was also full and would have to wait for one 5 hours into the future at 4:30am. Talked to several of the people getting on this shuttle and was told that they had just made their reservation within the last couple of hours and they were getting on the shuttle.  Also the prior company had personnel in the airport to check in passengers before their shuttle. They also had larger vans to accommodate more passengers if needed. Seems in this case it was needed, and they had knowledge of this when the weather problems developed.  Now the driver checks in passengers after he arrives in the middle of the hectic traffic situation outside on the platform.  The first driver was there over a half hour trying to figure who was supposed to be on the shuttle. He had no idea what was going on with the passengers and their scheduled ride!! I finally got on this last shuttle after the driver said he had no idea who was actually supposed to be on this shuttle and it looked like he had room for one more passenger.

Unfortunately, I have to say that it didn't quite do it for me. \n\nI visited on a Thursday morning around 10:30a and had no problem with finding a place to park near by. But I did have about a ten minute wait in line to order and it took about another fifteen for my order to come out. I knew in advance exactly what I wanted - that french toast! I'd seen the pictures and it was beautiful! And that's exactly how mine came out. So beautiful that I had to snap a couple pictures before I dug in, despite the way my mouth was watering.\n\nAfter the picture taking was done, I put down my phone and picked up my knife and fork to cut the first bite....easier said than done. This french toast was very tough - the bread was obviously on the thick and chewy side to begin with and the egg batter obviously hadn't changed that. I really needed a steak knife if I actually wanted to cut into it - I eventually resorted to picking the whole piece up with my fork and then awkwardly biting into the thick slice. While I appreciated the thick cut on the toast, nothing could make up for the texture. Personally, I prefer my french toast to be super soft and custardy. I spent most of my time rubbing the toast all over my plate, trying to soak up as much syrup as I could in order to soften it.\n\nAs far as the other parts of the dish were concerned...I did love the syrup. Apparently it's house made and does have a bit of a citrus flavor to it. I thought it was very nice.

Since fries were one of the items they managed to run out of, they offered to sub a different side with the steak and frites, which was okay except they forgot to bring out the substitution. They were nice enough to take a drink off the check for that mess up. The cauliflower rice paella was good, however it didn't come standard with seafood which was $7 extra.

Great sushi chefs usually spend years in Japan refining their technique. Every little detail is perfected. Subtle rice seasoning, tight rolling, choosing the best fish... it all takes years of experience to master.\n\nYamato is the big fish in Tucson's non-existent pond. It is located in a run down area of town, on Grant between 1st and Park.\n\nI stepped in and didn't regret it. The tiny place exuded authenticity and charm. I saw an older Japanese man behind the bar and heard Japanese karaoke playing in the background. It wasn't crowded, but there was a constant flow of small groups of people who appeared to be regulars.\n\nMy companion and I sat at the sushi bar. Right after he finished making the other customers' rolls, he greeted us and handed us steaming hot damp towels. He could tell we were new customers. Next, he handed us some chilled refreshing edamame. I ordered the red snapper, halibut, and sweet shrimp. He asked me if I wanted the head for the sweet shrimp, but I declined since I'm not a fan of sucking fresh brains. Yamato gets brownie points for authenticity for even giving me the option, though. My companion ordered the more generic California roll and Philly roll.\n\nThrough observing the chef, I could detect years of experience. His movements were quick and precise yet not in a rush. I also noticed that he had extremely long fingernails (just a tad longer than those of a Spanish guitarist). I do not know if they were for sushi work purposes, but they were clean so I had no worries. As he was preparing the sushi, he started some friendly conversation with us. \n\nHe presented as much sushi as would fit on one plate, then transferred the rest onto it as my companion and I devoured a section of the plate. The food was extremely fresh-tasting. The tastes were subtle, not fishy. Each fish had the correct texture. It was prepared well so it did not fall apart. My fish sushi was also tied with a string of shiso, something I have never come across in another Tucson sushi joint. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nAcross the sushi bar, a business man came in. He was obviously a regular as he and the chef chatted often. I saw the chef shucking some oysters on the rocks, which also appeared extremely fresh.\n\nPaying good attention to my companion and I, the chef noticed quickly when we were done with our sushi. He called the hostess for a chef and handed us a plate of fruit. There were two slices each of watermelon and what my palate instantly recognized as Chinese pear.\n\nOn my second trip, I ordered a rainbow roll.  It was delicious and my date gobbled it up quickly.  I ordered the red snapper again and it appeared to be the highlight of the meal, so I recommend it.\n\nI ordered the tempura ice cream.  The ice cream was a little melted but the sliced fresh strawberries made up for it.\n\nYamato is my favorite sushi place. The atmosphere is small, cozy, but not congested. The sushi is incredible for Tucson. It is in a poor location but is definitely worth the trip.","date":"2009-10-13 22:24:45","vector":[0.204037931,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1147]}

It's definitely my favorite Japanese restaurant in Tucson for food quality and authenticity.

It's a dish that gives me such nostalgia for Japan, and Yamato has my favorite katsudon in Tucson. The oshinko is prefect as well, either in katsudon or as an appetizer. They also have fabulous sushi, but you do have to pay quite a bit for it. I can only ever afford two or four pieces of nigiri, but even so, this is the only Tucson sushi I can reliably count on for taste.

And unfortunately, Red Kitchen didn't live up to my expectations.  It wasn't horrible, but...\n\nUpon being seated, we were told our server would be with us shortly.  After a bit of a wait, she showed up.  Mimosas were ordered and we headed down to the buffet.\n\nNow, the buffet was set up a bit oddly -- breakfast items were between brunch\/lunch items for instance.  If there's such a thing as buffet feng shui, they are in dire need of a tuneup.  It just felt weird.  But as a semi-literate adult, I was able to add items to my plate and head back to the table.\n\nThe food was OK -- Eggs Benedict (mostly overcooked, poached should be runny, but hey, they're making a dozen at a time, so I'll give them a break), French toast, bacon, sausage, potatoes, seafood (mostly disappointing - itty bitty crab legs, clams, oysters (not good), shrimp (only good part - fresh and big)).\n\nThey had brunch\/lunch options as well -- chicken breast, soups (corn chowder and clam chowder), three meats at the carving station (prime rib -- pretty good), a ham, and a lamb (this was probably the best thing they had, especially with the jalapeno mint sauce).\n\nFinally, there were desserts -- white and dark chocolate mousse (pretty good), a creme brulee cheesecake (way better in theory than application), and some other things that weren't sampled.\n\nThe mimosas were made with Wycliff sparkling wine (which is a Gallo brand screw top sparkling wine, in case you're curious.  It's fairly inexpensive, but gets decent reviews.  Much to my disappointment, it has no relationship to Wyclef Jean nor John Wycliffe).\n\nNow, this is fine (hey, it's not like they're going to make it with Dom), BUT the mimosa filling up frequency was less than ideal.  We saw plenty of servers walking around with pitchers of juice and a bottle of Wycliff, but only when giving the \"FILL US UP NOW\" death stare did we get service.  And it wasn't really that busy.  If they had just dedicated one or two servers to do the refills, they would have been fine.\n\nFinally, while we were taking a bit of a digestion break, our server came over with our check (\"take your time\").\n\nDamn right we will.  We had only been there for about 45 minutes.  It was a wee bit odd (and threw me off - I initially filled out the hotel guest version of the bill where you can charge it to a room.  Yes, tempting, but I'm an honest egg.  Mostly).\n\nSo, finally, the price.  For the quality of the food and the quality of the service, it felt a bit too expensive ($39.00 per adult).\n\nWhile this keep me from coming back to Red Kitchen for dinner and drinks?  No, because it is really good.  But would I go back for another buffet?  Very doubtful.","date":"2010-04-04 17:21:49","vector":[0.1146172414,0.0,0.0,0.0132,0.0]}

However, I never encountered anything too dreadful or waited more than a few minutes for anything. \n\nThe restaurants at the festival brought their A game. It was a very pork and slider heavy event, but each vendor had their own twist to these mini sandwiches.

The first thing that strikes you about Aquaknox is the muted lighting, the entire restaurant is lit in soothing shades of blue that slowly shift between blue and green. \n\nUpon ordering, we were informed that two of the menu selections were unavailable because the chef did not like the quality of the fish that they received, upon further inspection we discovered that the seafood is flown in fresh every day from various locations.  Our sampler oyster appetizer contained oysters from the North East, the West Coast, as well as the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nWhile this makes for good show, isn't it a bit much in Florida, where seafood literally is towards the marina. If they are flying it in, you are probably paying for it, and this reflected in both the price of the food as well as portions served. \n\nWhile the food we received was near impeccable, the only problem that we found was that it took a bit longer than expected for the food to come out. \n\nIf you are looking for a premier seafood restaurant in the area with a touch of class and impeccable food, Aquaknox serves as your destination. \n\n\nPros: Seafood, Decor\nCons: Price, Speed of Service","date":"2009-04-09 13:14:13","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060666667,0.0]}

I frequent this Panera location. Here are some reasons why I keep going back to this particular Panera:\n1. My Panera Card that keeps giving me free coffee or free bagel. I am super excited if I have a free latte or free Pick 2 or free Breakfast Sandwich... Their rewards card is awesome, and it is FREE!!!\n2. Convenient location for coffee and breakfast. I know there is Starbucks coffee inside the Target store nearby. Unfortunately, Target's Starbucks often messes up the taste of their brewed coffee. Plus, I do not like to drive to Starbucks in Broad Ripple or further north on Keystone to just get a cup of coffee. Panera coffee is good enough for me\n3. Drive-thru - I love the fact they have a drive thru for my lazy day. Although sometime the service is very slow. One time there was a lady in the car in front of me who ordered almost $50 worth of meal (i could see the price from the screen by the drive thru window. Maybe for a family dinner?) at the drive-thru. I had to wait for a long time for a cup of coffee... :-(\n\nI personally do not like dining in at this location. It is not well ventilated and I often smell the burning bagels or bread. During lunch hour, it is always hard to find a place to sit down, let alone order the food. Also in the morning, there is usually only 1 person at the register and the line can be pretty long. They need to improve the speed of the service and the quality of their customer service. The food is OK, though sometime the turkey sandwich is too salty for me. It is quite pricey, especially if you order their Signature sandwich.","date":"2011-11-30 06:01:44","vector":[0.1391625,0.0,0.0,0.2123,-0.34]}

This review is simply due to the service at this location. After a fun weekend of not grocery shopping, Monday morning I needed a quick coffee and smoothie to start my day. I was the only one here around 7:40 am and ordered a smoothie and a cold brew with almond milk. The person making my smoothie  was talking to their colleague and going extremely slow....like multiple pauses in adding stuff to the blender so they could finish their sentences. If it was on a weekend day, fine, I wouldn't care. Being on a Monday morning when it's pretty clear I'm trying to go to work it was extremely irritating. To add to the irritation, when I FINALLY get my smoothie I have to ask for a cup and almond milk to pour the coffee in. Usually when I visit UJ in the arcade, they are on their game and it's ready in a whiz. To add to this unpleasant experience, when I am finally at work, sitting at my desk, sipping my not very well made smoothie, I spot a hair at the bottom. Perfect. I will probably not go back to this location and stick to the arcade as the arcade is clearly trained to handle people on the way to work and I've never seen a hair in anything I've ordered :)","date":"2018-06-12 02:09:00","vector":[-0.0233818182,0.0,0.0,0.100475,0.0]}

I used to live next to the mid town location, and ate there at least once a week. When I moved Northwest, I was ecstatic to see that there was a mandarin grill less than a mile from me again. I was excited, that is, until I tried their food. I could go on and on and tell you all the story of my horrific experiences with them, but ill spare you the details and just tell you that I have given them 4 chances over the past year (several months between each try), and NOT ONCE have they ever gotten my order correct. Really...how hard is it to add baked tofu to broccoli with oyster sauce? And since when do vegetable spring rolls have pork in them? Now, getting an order wrong is something I can live with--im a patient person--so long as you correct the error, I wont be upset. Problem is, the food tasted TERRIBLE too! EVERY TIME. Just aweful. I found out the reason for this just recently: apparently the guy who owns this mandarin is the brother of the lady who owns the central location. 10 yrs ago, when this new franchise location opened, they trained him to cook at the central location. Upon opening the restaurant, he changed the recipes citing that \"his customers like it that way\". The central mandarin received SO MANY complaints, that they actually abandoned the franchised location and now claim to be \"unaffiliated\". I was also informed that if it were not for the fact that its a family member who owns it, a law suit would be filed because he kept the name and menu thus devaluing their brand.

It's definitely a place for those with a sweet tooth.  There's an abundance of chocolate treats of all sorts. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, chocolate drinks and chocolate mousse.  There are other things on the in-store menu so we tried the chilaquiles which are sort of like a bowl of nachos but different. Ours had feta cheese with oil and garlic.  These were delicious and very unique.  If course we had coffee and I must say that my large cup was so good that I was sad to see the bottom of my cup. I drink it black and yet it was not at all bitter.  The owner was so enthusiastic and welcoming; she definitely made us feel like welcomed guests.  Inside there are displays of the works of local artists and craftspeople. There are also displays of bags of chocolate to take home so of course I bought one.   The caf\u00e9 is very clean and comfortable inside plus there are chairs and small tables outside by the sidewalk as well as in the back on a wood patio.  We arrived on a weekday morning and had no difficulty finding some on-street free parking but I think that it might be more challenging to find parking on weekends.  \n\nThis caf\u00e9 has a genuine Mexican vibe to it as the owner is from Mexico City.  As much as we enjoyed the chocolate, it and the nachos, it would be nice if they expanded to include some healthy small meals. Perhaps that will come in the future. If you love coffee, chocolate and culture you will love visiting this caf\u00e9.  I hardly recommend it.","date":"2021-06-16 16:57:11","vector":[0.132255,0.0,0.0,0.05464,0.0]}

This past Saturday, my boyfriend and I decided to brave the cold and check out the spot. Now, have it be known that we are no brunch snobs by any measure. No matter what the menu boasts, we usually end up getting eggs with toast\/hash browns or an omelette\/pancake type dish. (Hence, why we LOVE diners!) Upon looking at the menu here, we were quickly disheartened by the little options they had on top of a lot of price inconsistencies, in my opinion. \nWe each ordered the Veggie Omelet (which does not include cheese!). What we got was a sad excuse for an omelet with overly chopped onions and tomatoes and 3 leaves of spinach with only ONE PEICE OF TOAST each. On top of that, I ordered rye and my boyfriend wheat...we both got wheat. It also came with their take on hash browns, which were the only redeeming part of the dish. Aside from my personal experience, I witnessed a member of the waitstaff bring a diner's food out to the bar, set it down and take multiple pictures of it ( in the view of everyone) before delivering it to the customer and saying \"I just posted a picture of these to facebook, you should like it\". In addition, their syrup comes in olive oil  glass bottles with that metal tip thing at the top (which doesn't allow any to come out), we had to ask for glasses of water and to have salt and pepper (which was moist and didn't come out of the shaker),  and no vegan options. \nMaybe it is because they are just starting out, but I will not be returning.","date":"2015-01-14 16:11:27","vector":[-0.035635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Everything... the omelet was full of good, fresh spinach and peppers but the egg was coated in oil. The bacon is amazing - Benton's, and a 'house' bacon that is maple\/black peppercorn - but still coated in oil or maybe just grease - if the kitchen just added one extra step of patting it with a papertoewl before sending it out would make a world of difference. Hashbrowns - seasoned fine and cooked decently, but again - coated in oil. The coffee is really good, I think it's Green Street. I like that you can stop in for a cup of coffee to go, a piece of fruit to go, or a soft drink\/yogurt parfait to go. I love that they have a crossword puzzle\/wordsearch paper that you can mess with while you're waiting. The staff if super friendly and attentive.

He was very helpful, knowledgeable and quite funny as an added bonus.  He was never pushy, and gave us time to discuss our options.  He helped us get a great deal on a 2015 Tucson as well as our trade in, which we were very pleased about.  We definitely recommend George!\n\nOur experience was slightly soured by our interaction with the finance aspect of our purchase.  The woman we dealt with on the Friday night kind of rushed us through some paperwork without much explanation and told us the rest would be explained when we picked up the vehicle.  We asked about securing the loan and other vehicle options (ie. undercoating, rust proofing) and their effect on the price, but we were told the vehicle's price was the final price, which didn't make sense.  When we were asked when we wanted to pick up the vehicle, and we suggested several days later, we got told we should pick up the next day, which we were a bit surprised about.  We didn't think that would be enough time to have the vehicle ready, but we were assured it would work.\n\nThe next day when we arrived, we were told the vehicle wouldn't be ready for another two days.  Thankfully with the Go Auto group we were able to get a loaner vehicle.  We then saw another finance person, who proceeded to sell us the other vehicle options we had asked about previously.  We had no problem waiting for our SUV, but would have appreciated a phone call to tell us about the delay.  When I did finally pick up our SUV, there was still a fair bit of plastic covering that I needed to pull off myself.\n\nWe will be returning to Southtown for our SUV's servicing, and hope that the service department is as great as the sales staff!","date":"2015-05-23 18:05:20","vector":[0.1366,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

It is right down the street from my parent's house, and has always been convenient.  My experiences have mostly been average to above average.\n\nHowever, my old grandpa recently went into this fine establishment to get burritos for my frail father after he returned from the hospital.  The workers at this Taco Bell helped him through his ordering process patiently, gave him advice on what to get, and offered to help him out to his car with his food.  They did everything they could, to make sure my grandpa could bring my dad the burrito that he was looking forward to having.\n\nThis type of service, especially at a time like this, really ingratiated me to this location.  The burritos seemed like they were made with extra care, and the patience they showed was really amazing.  Fast food is fast food, but it is the way that that food is delivered and presented that separates certain locations from others.\n\np.s. I am not trolling.

There is a counter\/register at the front door with a pile of to-go menus sitting next to it.  I was not sure if we were supposed to order at the register then seat ourselves while we waited for food (like Noodles and Company).  Nope.  Apparently, they seat you, bring you a menu, and then take your order like at a regular restaurant.  But since we were not greeted when we walked in and offered a seat, I proceeded to look like an idiot trying to order... next time I'll know better.  The restaurant was slow (only one other table was seated), so maybe everyone was just taking a break when we showed up.\n\nThe menu is random\/varied- Greek, sandwiches, burgers, salads, bar-type appetizers.  If you can't find something you like, then you just don't like food.  I ordered a burger (you have the option of a single, double or triple).  I was able to add cheese and grilled mushrooms.  I expected an extra charge for adding extras, but nope.  That was a welcome surprise.  There are also specialty burgers already on the menu loaded up with toppings if you don't want to \"make your own.\"  The burger (cooked to your preferred temperature) was served with a very generous portion of steak fries.  They needed salt, but salt is on the table... so no complaints there.\n\nMy dining companion ordered the gyro sandwich.  He was so happy that it was served wrapped up in foil to keep all the goodies inside the pita (similar to a Chipotle burrito where you can peel the foil down gradually as you eat so that you don't have a mess on your hands, or on your plate).  He was able to add feta for about fifty cents more.  The gyro had the choice of fries or soup on the side.  He ordered soup, but was served fries (about half the amount I had on the side of my burger).  About halfway through eating, the server came out with the soup and apologized for it not being ready at the same time as the rest of the food.  I'm thinking she just forgot about the soup and only realized her mistake when she came back over and saw we both had fries.\n\nOverall they could use a little bit more training of the hostess\/server to make sure customers are greeted\/seated promptly and to make sure the correct food is being served.  I'll definitely go back- gotta support small local businesses, right?","date":"2016-02-03 20:30:27","vector":[0.0174407407,0.0,0.3612,0.0,0.0]}

Went to try the breakfast brunch which is an all you can eat buffet. My husband had the buffet and enjoyed it. Items to choose from were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, chicken Parmesan, chicken fried steak, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, Greek salad, prime rib, cheesecake and Baklava. He enjoyed the food, really liked the chicken fried steak, prime rib with horseradish and Greek salad. He wanted a second piece of baklava but no more room. Portions were small but since they were unlimited it makes it easier to eat a variety with less waste. I would have had the buffet but was hoping it had more Greek food than just the salad. I ordered off the menu and had a hard time choosing between Greek Pastitsio and a sandwich. Went with the sandwich this time -- Blackened Chicken Wrap. It was soooo good, peppers, saut\u00e9ed onions, diced tomatoes, lettuce,cheese and bacon with a ranch sauce all in a grilled wrap. It came with fries that were some of the best I've had - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Pastitsio next visit. \n\nEasy parking in the lot on the side and back. \n\nWe were greeted and seated quickly. Our waitress was attentive.

The two owners (Jess and Larkin) are wonderful people, very welcoming and open to discussion\/questions\/feedback\/etc. It feels like I have known them for years when I just met them. I like that I am helping to support a smaller, local (and woman owned) business instead of the big corporate fitness places. I was able to purchase a new client\/grand opening package that was very affordable. The place itself is a little smaller with two exercise rooms-- a smaller barre room and larger yoga room. I think I actually like the smaller barre room better- more mirrors to keep form in check. Both are still big enough to accommodate decent class sizes. They have one of the fancy fountains to fill your water bottle, clear lockers for your purse\/personal belongings, two changing rooms and two bathrooms--- no showers.

I went in after dark, and the lighting in this place gives it the ambience of an interrogation room. Lots of cold white LED pots which remove any semblance of warmth from the room. I would never actually eat in the restaurant, and frankly found it extremely uninviting.\nThe staff, however were very warm and inviting, and greeted me as soon as I stepped through the door. The young lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful, and let me peruse the menu before helping me make my order.\nRight off the hop, like every other boutique burger joint, the burgers are NOT cheap. A plain burger with no add ons is $7.99 and a simple bacon cheese burger is $10.00, as are most other 2 topping types. (there are other standard toppings included) this is daunting for a first visit when one is accustomed to a Teen Burger mentality.\n\nI opted for the Old Style Bacon Cheddar Burger for $10 and a side of fries for $3.69. The girl at the counter took my name, told me to take a seat, and that my order would be brought out to me in about 10 minutes.\nThe kitchen is open, so you can watch the crew as they go through the routine, and they are good at what they do.\nI watched them prepare a number of orders ahead of mine, they called out peoples names as they went, and they even noted when they were working on my order so I expected it as it came up.\nI watched them package it up, and watched them dump some extra fries in the bag. (A nice touch.)\n\nMy order took just under the quoted 10 minutes, and smelled delicious. It was still toasty when I got it home, as there was no way I was eating in the restaurant...\n\nThe burger did not seem too big when I unpacked it, but when I started to get into it, it was dense and delicious. The patty was perfectly cooked with a serious quantity of bacon and real cheddar cheese. Lots of fresh tomato and lettuce, and quality condiments.\nThis was NOT a Teen Burger. \nThis WAS a $10.00 hamburger...\nThe fries were also very good, and in a very generous portion. If this was the regular, there is no way I could have eaten a large.\nProperly cooked, double fried... crispy on the outside and light on the inside.\nI was stuffed and happy when I had finished this meal.\n\nPositives:\nDelicious Burger\nExcellent Fries\nNo stupid Secret menus\nGrease did not soak through the bag into the upholstery of my car\nVaried and interesting menu\n\nNegatives:\nUninviting restaurant\nExpensive for fast food\n\nAll in all, I will return to this place, but not often.\nI can still get a good burger AND fries at more traditional places for the price of the burger alone here.\n\nPerhaps I am just getting old and cheap... ;)","date":"2018-02-16 04:25:20","vector":[0.0299142857,0.0,0.0,0.0866090909,0.0]}

Huge selection of drafts and cans. We sat at the bar and got some Smoked Wings and a pepperoni and banana pepper NY pizza. The wings were very meaty but a little over sauced, so they were really messy and not as crispy as the photos I had seen. Would probably ask for extra crispy next time.

I tell him to just go over toward the store and here are a bunch of food options. He knew I wasn't happy so he picked Jersey Mike's since it's quick and relatively cheap. We were greeted when we walked in and the workers seemed kinda overwhelmed with the orders that were coming in but they were trying to hide their frustrations.  I noticed right away that they were training because the lady starting the orders had to explain every sandwich and every step for the lady next to her. Obviously this slowed the process down. But the gentleman that was working the grill jumped over to help the new girl ring transactions so she could focus on one thing at a time. This guy was so nice and peppy and made a comment about how I needed sunscreen. I responded coldly with \"I'm allergic\" which is true. So he tells me he just found out about these new anti-allergen sunscreens that help people allergic to normal sunscreens. It was nice of him to do.  He was telling us he just moved out here from California and had no idea how brutal the sun was and how he also needed to get some sunscreen. I tell ya, he was giving it his to make my grump go away, probably because he thought I was annoyed at the slow service, or maybe he's just a happy and nice guy. Anyway, it comes up that we've never eaten there and he says \"Oh get a free cookie for a rookie!\" and that made me smile and helped turn my day around. Such a small gesture made a big impact on me. We sit down to eat and I got the Philly cheesesteak sub, it was really good. It was just the right amount of messy, had ooey gooey cheese all over, and I really enjoyed it.  I love Philly cheesesteaks but it's hard to find one done right and this one sure was.  The cookie wasn't super fresh but still good and obviously free so I can't complain. \nThe entire restaurant was pretty clean and the guy and the trainer girl kept their attitudes positive the entire time we were there. When they weren't helping customers, they were cleaning which I always love to see when I'm at food establishments. \nThe only thing I struggled with was their menu. They had random numbers and they all seemed out of order and had no clear reasoning behind why the numbers weren't chronological. But I guess, that's a small complaint and doesn't really hold much importance when you go out to eat.","date":"2019-04-12 22:59:41","vector":[-0.00164,0.0,0.0,0.1774,0.0]}

Location is very convenient in Morgan Hall- right on the corner of Broad and Cecil B.Moore, outside of the Broad Street Line station. The interior design and ambiance is pretty consistent with that of the center city location. Outdoor seating adds a nice touch, especially during this time of the year when it's still really nice out. Unlike the center city location, this place is not extremely packed, which is a huge plus.\n\nFood is ordered on touch screen monitors and food options include various types of salad and stir fry. For those who are familiar with the honeygrow in Center City, this location does not offer the kale'atta smoothie, however, I believe all other food items are the same. This is a perfect healthy alternative to Temple's campus food. Service was friendly, but a little slow. Although there were no orders in front of me, I had to wait for about 10-15 minutes before my  stir-fry was ready. But from what I know, this place recently opened (about 2 weeks ago?) so I can be understanding of this. Aside from the service, I was quite satisfied with the food quality. My stir-fry came with a lot of toppings and vegetables, base-protein-vegetable ratio was on point, and I received all of my ordered ingredients. \n\nDefinitely not the most affordable food option you'll find on campus, but the quality is worth the price in my opinion.

It is not\"A-OK\".  It's barely a step above \"Meh, I've experienced better\".\n\nI am astounded that this place is getting so many rave reviews.  Am I missing something here, or did I perhaps go on a night when the sushi chefs were having an off night?  Do I really need to go back here and give this place another chance?  I consider myself a good judge of sushi, having eaten at Shogun at least 200 times (Review to come soon; I promise).\n\nIf you work in the CBD or warehouse district, and you want satisfy your craving for sushi, then I guess this place will suffice.  However, everything we ordered was simply mediocre.\n\nWe ate here the night of the Night Ranger \/ Foreigner \/ Journey concert and were looking for a decent meal near the New Orleans Arena so that we did not have to eat stadium food for dinner. \n\nOur order consisted of:\n\nCucumber salad - no fills here & pretty small in size\nShrimp tempura sushi - tasted like a frozen Mrs. Pauls or Gorten's shrimp\nBBQ yellowtail roll - average at best\nNew Orleans roll - probably the most decent thing we had\n\nOn a positive note, the sushi bar was pretty big for such a small restaurant.  The staff was friendly, the waitress was attentive to our drink refills and the restaurant was clean.  If you're in a hurry, then this place gets two thumbs up because the sushi chefs must pride themnselves in serving the fastest sushi in the business.  You could literally sit at the sushi bar, order two rolls and be out of there in 10 minutes.","date":"2011-09-26 14:55:46","vector":[-0.037,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I can't comment on their selection from a very experienced standpoint, but I DID think that they had a nice selection from what I could tell. As many places do, they have their wines organized by location, with one rack dedicated to each region. Accompanying each type of wine, they have a description, and by many wines, they have the face of one staff member who recommends it. There are many organic and biodynamic wines mixed in with the others, but surprisingly they also have an entire rack devoted to these. \n\nThere are several display racks in the store recommending various wines, with different themes. As I was heading out of the store today I realized that they also have a shelf that's 12% off (a sign told me so), but I didn't see it. \n\nEvery Saturday afternoon they do wine tastings. \n\nI was talking to one of the owners, who told me that every wine they sell is tasted and agreed upon by the business partners.

Their selection of meats is bar-none--I mean amongst the choices they have 3 kinds of ham alone: Black Forest, lean, and honey. They cut their salami and pepperoni long-wise which I always found interesting. Their cheese selection is wide too; I especially enjoy the horseradish cheddar. Their fresh breads are many from the croissant, Dutch crunch, Swiss onion, rosemary, white, wheat, sourdough, and more. They tend to have 3 or 4 fresh soups daily too. One I especially liked was the mushroom brie. Finally the produce is very fresh, and they're generous with the avocados. When I first learned of Deli Towne it seemed weird that they're located in a gas station market, but don't let that keep you away. I have colleagues that eat here daily.","date":"2010-10-08 07:39:43","vector":[0.1144666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02606]}

It's just been one of those places that has been on my list, but I can always get a sandwich at a place closer to my house, so I've just never made it over there. Well, I was craving a sandwich and wanted to try something different, so here we are...\n\nI had a medium turkey sandwich with horseradish cheddar on the Swiss Rosemary Garlic bread. The sandwich got 4 slices of cheese (you would probably only get 2 at a chain) and a hefty amount of turkey. I loaded it up with fresh toppings and I was starting to wonder how they'd even close it up and make it edible (without losing all in the innards all over yourself). But they expertly flipped it over, cut it in half and wrapped it up. This was the size of a small infant, but I'd hope for that big of a sandwich for $9. It was really good and filling, but some of my flavors (like the horseradish cheddar) got muddled by the rest (maybe I should have got some horseradish sauce on there to amp up that flavor?)\n\nI like the variety of options that you have - more choices than just wheat, white, or some sort of cheesy kind. Same with the different kinds of cheeses. This definitely gives them some extra points!  However, sometimes I'm just not in the mood to design my own sandwich, so it'd be nice if they had some already \"designed\" sandwiches on their regular menu. \n\nThey do have monthly specials, which this month was meatballs with marinara on Vampire Killer bread, topped with pepper jack cheese. This is what my boyfriend got. At first he was a little disappointed that he didn't get to add any additional toppings, but after he starting eating it, he said that it was just great the way it was and definitely big enough without the extra toppings. I tasted one of the meatballs, and I'm pretty sure that are pre-made, frozen meatballs, but I guess I could be wrong about that...\n\nWe both got a medium cup of the broccoli cheddar soup too. But by the time we ate our sandwiches, we were too full for much of the soup so it got saved for a snack later that night. It was good, but needed a touch of salt, and could have been a little bit creamier. \n\nWith two sandwiches and two cups of soup, we came in at $29. Ouch. It is a lot of food for the price, but I'd expect prices like that in a sit-down, diner like setting, not a gas station sandwich shop (but don't let the fact that it is in a gas station deter you from trying it out - if you haven't already).","date":"2014-10-28 16:18:09","vector":[0.0535604167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0266692308]}

Took another 15 minutes to get our drinks (waters) and took even longer to put in orders. Every time she came out of the kitchen, she was only carrying drinks. No food was coming out of the kitchen. It was ridiculous. I enjoyed the famous salad and my chicken sandwich, I just wish we hadn't spent 2 hours there and had to flag down our server for everything.

The valet recommended Columbia Caf\u00e9, and mentioned that there was an outpost just a few minutes down the Riverwalk.  Since it was a bit late to make it to the original in Ybor City, my colleague and I were delighted to find something so close to our hotel.\n\nYou should know going in that this location of the Columbia Caf\u00e9 has a condensed menu that is much smaller than the original location.  I was somewhat disappointed, but it's fair that a restaurant located in a museum would want to keep their menu manageable for the size of the space and the staff.  \n\nIt also struck me as a bit awkward that the entrance is not clearly marked.  We walked into a really nice outdoor patio seating area, but there was no host stand and we were not sure if we needed to go inside to be seated.  We walked inside and up the stairs to the bar area and waited a few minutes until a server appeared.  She told us to sit anywhere, so we went back outside and chose a table.  We then waited for 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server and offered drinks.  No one was eating inside, but the patio was somewhat busy and the restaurant appeared to be understaffed.  There was no real system for servers to approach diners, so others who sat down after us were greeted sooner.  I sympathize with staff in this type of situation, but it seems that management should plan and staff more appropriately.  I'm also not sure if the fact that this was in the evening after the museum closed had anything to do with the small staff, but given the lack of restaurants near downtown hotels, I would expect this location to do a healthy dinner business.\n\nWhen we did get to order and eat, everything was fantastic.  We had the sangria prepared table-side, which was slightly gimmicky but fun.  My colleague had the cubano sandwich and I ordered the Picadillo Criollo and a side of sweet fried plantains.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  The view from the patio of the channel is nice, and once we were eating and drinking, the meal was a really pleasant experience.

I needed something fast, delicious, and filling that didn't necessitate me having to turn on my stove (it's hot as balls out today).  So, I pulled out my trusty yelp app and searched for cheap local food.  \n\nI got there and asked if they take credit cards and was quickly told no.  They did however have one of those tiny ATM machines that one could easily carry out the store on their back. So I paid the $1.50 ATM fee and ordered 2 slices of pepperoni (for the kids) and a Cheese Steak and fries for myself.  Me Hungry.  Must have protein.  \n\nThe place had a good bit of action for a Thursday.  At least 5 of the booths were filled and I observed people were filing in and out with orders while I waited for my food. It took less than 10 minutes for the guy at the counter to shout the \"steak with hot peppers and 2 slices\" were ready to go.  Goody!  I grabbed our food and headed to the car.  Eager to try the food I unwrapped the steak and picked out a piece with my fingers.  It was hot as heck so I could barely taste it but I was like this is a little bland.  Then I considered the fact that I hadn't had the whole experience yet so I wrapped it back up and drove home.  \n\nOnce I got home I unwrapped the sandwich and found that the steam from the heat had caused the bread to become extra soft and the juices from the hot peppers to saturate the meat and bread just a bit. As I bit into the sandwich I was pleasantly surprised that my first impression had been way off.  The sandwich was good.  The hot peppers lent the perfect amount of spice to the surrounding meat and bread and I detected just a bit of sweetness somewhere in there.  The cheese was melty and delicious.  This was a first rate cheese steak!  Much better than the diced dog food they serve at Geno's.  I honestly would give the cheese steak five stars but I have to downgrade the restaurant overall to four because their pizza was mediocre in my opinion.  NY style pie, large slices for about $1.50 each but the sauce is all but  non existent.  That's a fail for me.  \n\nEven still I would still go to this place just for the sandwiches.  A cheese steak, fries, 2 slices, and a drink so large you can swim in for $10.95? Sounds like a deal to me!","date":"2011-07-07 23:44:49","vector":[0.0804851064,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1075818182]}

Never in my whole entire life have I ever been to a place that handled a situation so horribly. So a group of us went in for Valentine's Day, we had a reservation for 8 and were sat by 845, no big deal we were just a bit cranky and hungry. The host was very nice and was trying her best. \n We finally get sat and get drinks ordered and Our appetizers. It's going well, our server was nice and we were happy. Now this is where it goes down hill. Our appetizers come out about 5-10 mins apart. We brushed it off. A party that got sat after us were now getting their entrees? We start getting irritable at this time we've been in the restaurant for 2 hours. We finally start getting out entrees. 5 people are missing theirs. Sever comes over tells our friend their out of what she wanted. Would've been nice to know before everyone stared receiving their food. But she got to pick whatever she wanted for free, not bad. Everyone is now done with their meals and My friend beside me never got her food. By this time the restaurant is basically empty. The manager comes over and just goes \" what did you have\" my friend told her then she just walked away. No apology. Nothing. Her food finally comes out and she asks our sever why was she just now receiving her food? He replies with \"oh you know the kitchen gets slammed, things happen\" our jaws nearly hit the floor. Granted they comped her meal. But everything was poorly executed and the manager never stopped by to apologize, our server never apologized. \n  I guessed they assumed that they were gonna go down in flames cause they thought passing out a $5 off coupon for next time would do anything. Safe to say we spent 3 hours in a restaurant for a lousy experience. The food was decent but not worth it. Like the saying goes \" you can fix lousy food with great service but you can't fix lousy service with great food\" and we don't ever, ever plan on coming back here.

Anthony cut her hair, and the results left me with such a wonderful impression. I had avoided salons for more than a year, but my ends kept crying for help. I gave in and set up an appointment for the following day. I have medium strands, but super dense ethnic hair. \n\nWhat I loved about my experience here:\n\n1.) Anthony works quickly and precisely.\n2.) He also listens to what you request! Sometimes you don't even need to mention certain things because he just picks up on them!\n3.) I thought I would get charged extra for my hair type, but no. He has one flat rate (at least for students)\n4.) I did not have to get my hair washed (I did it the night before anyway). He just cut off the dead ends on my dry hair, and I could see the difference in my hair's behavior immediately.\n\nMy visit lasted maybe 25-30 minutes, and I left very pleased (even though my bun looked a little funny after due to my layered locks). When I flatironed my hair the following week, it had so much bounce and acted way more obediently. My search has finally ended (as long as I can get here regularly), and I will continue to visit Anthony for a regular trim.","date":"2011-01-16 01:12:14","vector":[0.220875,-0.1027,0.0,0.0,-0.1022]}

The first time, a friend of mine was reeled in by the student discount sign in the window, and she wasn't looking to get anything too elaborate done, so I tried to be of whatever help I could to suggest what she should get done.  Her stylist seemed friendly but I felt bad for her because she was the only one working that day and was scrambling to keep her focus on the client while having to answer the phone and buzz people in if they rang the bell.  Only downside is that the student discount does not include a blow-dry, so keep that in mind, especially if you don't like to leave the salon looking like you just got out of the shower.  \n\nThe second time, I met some guys at Cake and the Beanstalk (the fairly new coffee shop down the street) who were visiting from out of town and one of them said he hadn't gotten his hair cut in 6 months, was looking to get it done that day, and had no luck finding an open salon (it was a Saturday afternoon).  I suggested Thomas Anthony's, so he headed over there while his 2 friends stayed at the cafe until we were all done our coffee--they invited me to come with them to the salon to wait with them until their friend was done.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stay and see the finished product because I had plans to meet up with friends at Moriarty's around the corner, but from the looks of it, things were going well, and I found out via text message that it ended up being a success.\n\nThe third time, a friend of mine kept asking me for suggestions as to what he should do with his hair, and after some deliberation, I suggested he get it cut at Thomas Anthony's.  On quite a rainy afternoon, he called ahead and was able to get squeezed in right before the shop closed.  As soon as we came in, we were greeted by Anthony (the owner), who was on his way out for the day, but he immediately struck up a conversation with me and seemed extremely personable and outgoing.  Jeannie (sp?), the stylist who stayed to do my friend's hair, was also very nice, she did a great job with the cut, and the entire time after we left, he was glowing!  There's something to be said for that...\n\nOne of these days I hope to give Thomas Anthony's a shot, but knowing so many stylists, I'm faced with a tough decision.  I will, however, recommend it to any college students out there looking for a good, simple haircut in a clean, friendly salon setting.","date":"2011-05-09 02:04:06","vector":[0.039225,0.0,0.0,0.1529333333,0.0278047619]}

I was talked(easily) into getting a combo with fries and a drink, even though I told myself initially I wasn't going to get fries. The fountain drinks are large, so I recommend emptying your bladder before leaving. The cheesesteak went down easily, and I probably could have put away a 12. And even though I wasn't really hungry afterwards, I wasn't full either, and tried some butterscotch Tastykakes, because why not? If you have never had them before, they are the Philadelphia equivalent of a Twinkie. Less spongy, and with the filling on the outside instead of the middle. \n\nAmbiance: Very relaxed at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Friday. It's a bar-slash-restaurant with a bit of a New York feel. Almost cozy.The bar is separated from the main seating area, but the place isn't too big. \n\nService: Service was ok. You order at the register, and they take your name (well, they forgot to take mine, so I was just \"Hey you\") and call you when your food is ready.\n\nTotal Impression: I can't say I liked the cheesesteak here any more than Frankie's or East Coast. They seem a tad blander than either, but then again I have never been to Philadelphia, and maybe cheesesteaks are supposed to be a bit bland. Maybe all the spicy foods in the Southwest have shot my tastebuds and I just can't taste as well as I used to. Either way, I can't say this place makes great cheesesteaks, but I can't say they don't either.","date":"2011-01-25 02:41:01","vector":[0.0879,0.0,0.0,0.1804333333,0.0997888889]}

It was inviting and the staff friendly.  I will definitely be returning.","date":"2016-07-20 01:32:19","vector":[0.1154363636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

At each restaurant, the chef or manager came out and told us about the food, history, and\/or their philosophy. Our favorite restaurant was the very first where the tour began - a modern, seasonal eatery that prided itself on it's sustainable philosophy, but which also flew in huckleberries from Delaware and trout from Scotland (which isn't terribly sustainable). From there we were given a 24 hour streetcar pass and took the streetcar into downtown Tucson. Clean, quite, convenient, the streetcar was my favorite part.\n\nThe guide was also soft spoken and could be hard to hear, especially for the elderly in our pack. A simple megaphone might help. While everything she said was true (to my knowledge),  the way she presented the information didn't make me confident she knew what she was talking about.

In the group were 2 adventurous foodies, 1 medium foodie, and 1 picky eater - the birthday girl! We wanted to make her try new things on this birthday trip, and we have teased her for years about being a picky eater. She went into the experience with an open mind, she tried everything she was served, and she surprisingly liked 99%. As for the 2 foodies in the group - we have traveled all over the world together, and we NEVER miss an opportunity to taste the local flavors. First all, the place where you meet for the tour alone is a very cool concept - it is a market made in the old style with everything being on the inside of the complex to encourage interactions with locals and people who are neighbors - some local folks even have their mailbox there! I understand that the tour changes\/rotates restaurants; the places that we tried were Augustin Kitchen, The Nook, Elliot's on Congress, Charro Steak House, and The Screamery Ice Creamery. I would go back to ALL of them based on what I was served. Our tour guide, Lysa, really gives thoughtful consideration to supporting local businesses. Every tasting included a brief commentary from the chef\/management, and we noticed that all of the businesses use as much locally grown and cultivated meat and produce as possible - farm to table concept was a huge factor, which I feel added highly to the experience. I really loved getting to hear some of the chefs speaking about their food - in particular the chefs at Augustin Kitchen and at Nook. At Augustin Kitchen the chef went into a lot of detail about the conscientious selection of responsible food sourcing and authentic recipes of value considering the cultural heritage of the area - specifically, Hispanic and Native American dishes. We were served top-notch fried calamari and wilted kale salad at Augustin Kitchen - absolutely delicious!! The next restaurant was Chef-owned Nook, and they served us tamale pie, breakfast fried rice, and a bluberry scone with strawberry jam topping. I really liked how the chefs talked about \"getting bored\" making things over and over. They said that their entire staff plays Iron Chef to come up with a rotating menu, and I really respect how they include the creativity of their entire team - the food reflects it! The third tasting, Elliot's on Congress, served good food (duck sliders and cole slaw), but their claim to fame is their infused vodka mixology, and I definitely enjoyed my drink! Charro Steak House served excellent albondigas and Chimichangas! The manager told us about the in house butchering for the freshest meat, and how so much of the art work was re-purposed materials from restaurant's history - very cool! The last stop was the Screamery Ice Cream. I am a tough critic when it comes to ice cream - the Screamery stood it's ground. So many flavors does make it hard to choose, but they automatically allow 2 flavors no matter what size you get. I had Almond Joy and Coffee - yummy!! I was completely stuffed, and waddling around like a marshmallow puff by the end of this tour! I could write a much longer, review..........but you should go on the tour yourself and taste! Last bits of info are these: along the way, your guide will be sharing a ton of local history, architecture, and art work.....so it's not only a food tour - it's a great way to see and experience downtown Tucson! Also, included in the tour is a 24 hour pass to ride the bus system. Lysa, our tour guide, is SO kind and accomodating. One of the gals on our trip got an eye infection earlier, and Lysa was very concerned about her and offered to help us in any way to be able to get her some care. i can't say enough good things about this experience!\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/ShowUserReviews-g60950-d7122044-r647162240-Taste_of_Tucson_Downtown-Tucson_Arizona.html#","date":"2019-01-20 17:02:27","vector":[0.1842264706,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1454807692]}

Woo Hoo!\n\nSomeone sent me a link to what sounded like the dinner of a lifetime: Join Chef Poon for a traditional 10-course Chinese New Year Banquet featuring dishes from 8 nations. It sure wasn't difficult to convince some friends to join me since the menu sounded absolutely wonderful.\n\nWhen we arrived at 1010 Arch street in Chinatown we found ourselves ascending a flight of dirty carpeted stairs that rewarded us with what looked like a wood-panelled storage room turned into emergency shelter\/Chinese banquet room.  You see, there was an abundance of personal items and restaurant supplies such as old chairs, lamps and boxes of Christmas decorations piled up along the front part of the 2nd floor space.  There was no pretentious covering this stuff up.  No, it was there it was flavor!  The tables set up for our party and the other groups of victims were actually stainless steel work bench tables you might see in an industrial kitchen.  But of course these were covered with white table covers that were bleached, and yet still stained, so often they were holy.  Folding chairs were covered with images of Chef Poon, which would be creepy if not for the striking resemblance and level of class that one would see at Buddakan.  Steven Starr, eat your hear out.  Also, my group being fortunate, we were placed at the much sought after tables with the best views.  We were actually in the space deemed \"the kitchen\"  The equipment and sinks were only a mere 5 feet from our table!\n\nNonetheless the mood was one of anticipation.  If the place was THIS humble, imagine how great the food must be!  So we began with ordering a round of drinks.  We had a choice of generic Chinese beer or a glass of cheep box wine for a bargain $6. \nWe had no idea what was in store for us.  The meal was over in less than 40 minutes and perhaps that's a good thing.  I wish you were there....\nOh.. let me walk you through it! No, no, it will be my pleasure to share this!\n\nThe first 2 \"courses\" were some mouthful-sized appetizer tastes that were actually pretty decent though tiny.  (Try and read the following as if you're training for the speed reading championships.)  These first courses were brought out at a leisurely pace of one per every... oh let's say 2.5 minutes.  It's a good thing though, since each of us had such supermarket-sample-sized portions we often were able to consume each before the next part of the feast arrived creating a sense of pride and accomplishment.  Honestly, there's no finer dining atmosphere better than that of  a pie eating contest and this was damn close to it.\n\nSo, as each dish was delivered to our work-bench table we found ourselves slowing down.  It was similar to when a child discovers something that causes pain and is reluctant try it again.\n\nLarger dishes to be shared were brought out and and presentation occurred all at once so it really started feeling like a feast.  The presentation of some seemed aesthetically pleasing, while others were a bit scary.\nMostly though the seafood was fishy.  The Bass was greasy and the salmon tasted old, like \"honey we should've thrown this out a week ago\" old.  The Fried rice dish was sweet and unpleasant while perhaps the lowest point of the meal was the Lobster dish. A large dish of linguine was covered by pieces of lobster broken to hard chunks still in their shell.  They were delivered with no tools to crack the shells or retrieve the lobster meat.  Digging with a fork seemed useless but in a way I was glad the lobster was till in it's impenetrable  shell; it protected it from being contaminated by the tangy-sour and glowingly artificial red BBQ sauce which stung the eye as much as the tongue. \n\nAnd being Chinatown, we certainly were treated to our well deserved happy ending.  The sumptuous dessert consisted of a half-inch square of still mostly frozen cheescake\/cookie pierced with a toothpick which held the single white grape on.  MMMmmmmhmmm. \nAnd then, the generosity flowed when Chef Poons staff rushed out to clank onto our table a half glass of Cook's sparkling wine. \n\nSo in the end we each paid $54 per person (in Chinatown!) for what we all agreed was our worst culinary experience to date. \n\n*Please note, the delay of this review is partially because this event predated my Yelp awareness and I had tried to suppress these memories.  Forgetting is hard though since  lately when my friends and I experience unpleasant meals or find ourselves greatly ripped off, we say we've been \"Pooned\".  It's become a handy verb.","date":"2008-08-14 18:35:36","vector":[0.0686030769,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0081461538]}

I got this class as a Xmas present for my husband thinking that it would be a fun, semi-romantic date that we'd both enjoy. It didn't really turn out that way. \n\nThe tickets for this class were $120 each, so we spent $240 total for the class. The class started with Chef Poon in the kitchen area making cheese wontons (which were actually the highlight of the night) and telling us bizarre stories about how much he volunteers and why he feels he needs to give back to America because \"we've done so much for him.\" Within the first 5 minutes of the class, we knew all about how many jobs he had turned down in order to volunteer, how much money he thinks he should be making, how much his plane tickets cost to go places, how much he makes for 7 minutes of motivational speaking, etc. Basically, you get to listen to Chef Poon talk about money throughout the entire class. It's really off putting. \n\nThen, the sushi portion began. We were each given a plate of tuna, tilapia, shrimp, one piece of octopus and some imitation crab meat. After a short demonstration on how to make a small ball of rice and put a piece of fish on top, we were sashimi experts. We then make two hand rolls and some maki. During the class, other students asked questions about where the \"sushi grade\" fish comes from, etc. Chef Poon saw nothing wrong with showing us the bagged, frozen pieces of fish that he buys from the supermarket to make his sushi. The price stickers were still on the bag. We could all see that in our $120 per person class, we were eating $4.00 bagged tilapia and $9 bagged tuna. We now understood why the fish was bland, at least. \n\nThroughout the class, Chef Poon also told us how much he'd charge for each of the rolls we were making (\"see this. $1 to make. I sell for $7. big mark ups.\") and also about how he is the only Chinese Masterchef in the world. I think it's funny that he also called a guy in our class \"Macho Man\" the entire time and that another reviewer noted that he did the same thing. Another funny part was when he showed us his candy making cookbook that \"has sold out\" and is longer available to purchase, yet, from the goodness of his heart, he donates to kids in prison to read. Yes, he donates his chinese candy making cookbook to prisoners. I'm sure they are beyond thrilled. \n\nThe class ended with a \"dinner,\" which was 4 pieces of filet and 5 pieces of general tso's chicken. The beef was good and so was the chicken, but Chef Poon couldn't just let us eat it and enjoy. He brought out the container of Lipton Demi Glace that he used to make the beef so tasty, which kind of ruined the whole thing. We could have made this at home with a purchase can of his \"secret sauce\" that we got at any grocery store in America. \n\nAll this to say, the class was way overpriced for what it was, and Chef Poon was actually a distraction and annoyance rather than being a voice of expertise. I wish I had done more research into Chef Poon's classes before purchasing, but, you live and you learn! \n\nDon't waste your money on his classes. Watch a YouTube video on how to roll sushi, get yourself a little kit, and head to Legal Seafoods to get some REAL sushi grade fish.","date":"2014-01-14 16:45:20","vector":[0.0418842105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0682612903]}

In a city that has so many great choices of affordable ethnic food, it's rare that I'll shell out $50 for dinner, let alone Chinese food, but the menu sounded fantastic.  I have never experienced such a disconnect between a printed menu and my actual taste buds as this.\n\nSince Foodie M did a pretty thorough job of describing the dismal decor, and the range of off beat (not in a good way) to just plain inedible dishes I'll try to keep my review brief (brief isn't my specialty though...).  As we sat down at the table I noticed a kind of funk wafting up my nose which I soon realized was a take out box of a previous diner's leftovers (From that day? From last week?  I'm not sure) they had wisely chosen not to take home with them, and had shoved in the shelf under the table.  (The tables aren't actual dining tables, but are kitchen prep tables).  This should have been the first sign.  Actually it was the first sign.  The meal progressed from dishes that were OK to dishes that were horrible. \n\nA few examples-\nSecond Course\nPeking Duck with Jicama and Spring Onion with Steamed Lotus Leaf Bun\n\nTranslation - A bite of duck in a bun that is chewy in the center, and so hard on the side you can hardly bite through it.\n\nSixth Course\nDouble Happiness Lobster with Lemon Pepper Linguini in Homemade Chili Tomato Mirin Essence\n\nTranslation - Lobster claws that are impossible to get out of the shell so forget about actually eating any, on a bed of linguini with BBQ sauce.\n\nTenth Course\nDessert: Ice Cream Cheesecake and Fresh Fruit Sculpture with Green Tea\n\nTranslation - A 1\" square of frozen cheesecake with a grape on a toothpick\n\nOK, so I guess a grape on a toothpick may qualify as a sculpture to some, but in my imagination it would be something slightly more.\n\nSo I realized that Joseph Poon the brand is really much more about the wacky persona than the food.

Furthermore, it seemed impossible for him to talk about the virtues of his cooking and his life philosophy without criticizing the cooking and philosophy of others. I found that negative and unnecessary. When he could sense that members of the group were not buying everything he was saying or were more interested in looking around, he was rather rude and critical of those people. His remarks were couched in humor, but they were inappropriate and took away from the experience. I found the assumptions he made about people (that all Americans are rich and have never had to work for anything and are lazy) and their interests (that women would want to hear about herbs\/spices that have been traditionally used for abortions) to be absolutely ridiculous and offensive. Finally, the meal served at the end of the tour by this chef, who suggested he had recently been visited by 15 of the top chefs in the country, served sweet and sour chicken with rice and a salad -- hardly inventive cuisine. I do not recommend this tour for anyone -- out of towners or those who reside in Philadelphia, as I do -- and especially not people who have been on food tours elsewhere.","date":"2011-12-05 01:08:38","vector":[0.0955166667,0.3182,0.0,0.0,0.0424333333]}

Read on...\n\nI received the tickets for the \"Double Happiness: Sushi & Dim Sum Class\" as a birthday gift. We got there early (get there early!) and we were wonderfully surprised that it was just us and one other couple (so, we had LOTS of hand-on training).\n\nFirst, we were shown the kitchen and Chef Poon told us lots of stories. Chef Poon is fascinating and if you take the effort to really listen to him, he's quite entertaining! His Sous Chef was a pleasure to talk to, too!\n\nThen we learned how to make the dumplings. I had no idea there were SO many kinds. We made quite a few and he allowed me to fry a batch. Yum. Really, very tasty!\n\nThen... it was SUSHI TIME...!\n\nWe stood at the table and made TONS of such. All kinds: a seaweed cone, with caviar, rice on the inside, rice on the outside with trays and trays of fish, shrimp, vegetable and more.\n\nAnd, we're eating as we are making them! Still, we had SO MUCH food left over... I took home FIVE TRAYS of amazing sushi! (So much that when I brought them to my mom's the next day, we still couldn't finish them!!)\n\nSo, we started packing up the food and Chef Poon motions us to a table... where he prepared DINNER! Steak, General Joe's Chicken (yum!!), a tasty salad and our dumplings.\n\nTruly, it was so delicious, but I needed to bring it home. I was stuffed! (I had it on Monday and it was extraordinary.)\n\nTHEN, because it was my birthday, he brought out a cake that he bought for me! I mean... that was so nice. (Thanks, Chef!)\n\n==========\n\nThat said... for $120 a person you get a LOT. Entertainment, two classes and a ton of food!\n\nI read some of the 1-star reviews and they are nitpicking on some things. (The price of the fish, compared to the price of the class. That's just silly. You're paying for world-class knowledge and FUN.)\n\nThe class was WELL worth the money! I was entertained, fed and had LOTS of food to take home!\n\nI highly recommend Chef Poon's classes!","date":"2014-05-07 19:10:13","vector":[0.1278875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16412]}

I think as a whole Round Table Pizzas has gone downhill.  My brother and I went back to the original one in Menlo Park recently (which is still owned by the original family) and found the pizza lacking.

TO GO because I had somewhere to be. I think most coffee houses\/cafes\/restaurants understand this concept. The place was not crowded.

Wrong. After 20 minutes (about twice the amount of time it would take me to make the breakfast sandwich myself, from start to finish, in my own kitchen), I inquired into the status of the kitchen. Is it backed up? Is something wrong? \n\"There are two orders ahead of your order\" I was informed. Now, based on the fact that it took 20 minutes for 2 orders to come out, my very rudimentary calculations conclude that it would take another 20 minutes until my little breakfast sandwich would even be a passing thought in the mind of the fry cook in the kitchen.\n40 minutes for a to go order?! Unacceptable. I asked for my order to be cancelled, and couldn't receive a refund unless I waited another unspecified amount of time in order to speak to the owner.  \nThe bottom line: can't comment on the quality of the food.

After years of trying to eat healthy, yet knowingly putting awful things into my body, I was all about it. We were introduced to Beth through a coworker and knew she was the right fit for our needs. Her comprehensive packet of information was so informative. I learned so much in such a short time. After a few days we were already feeling the effects of the cleanse, inside and out, and were loving it. Beth was supportive throughout the cleanse. She was always willing to chat if need be and sending us pep talks via email every morning. She is so enthusiastic about eating clean and healthy, it's contagious!\n\nIt felt good to be eating guilt free and knowing that what I was putting into my body was going to help me rather than hurt me. I went from eating only when I was starving, thus making poor choices, to planning my meals way ahead of time. It was fun to go through Beth's recipe book and prepare for the week. Her recipes are delicious, fun and easy to make!!! Even weeks after strict cleansing I still incorporate her recipes into my daily routine.\n\nWeeks later I feel better about myself and my food choices and have even dropped a few pounds as well. I am way more aware of what I'm eating and putting into my body, which is probably the best thing I could have taken from this experience. Knowledge is power and now that I have learned so much from Beth, I am confident I'll never fall back into those bad habits. I feel like I started a whole new life style and I could never have done it without her guidance and assistance.","date":"2013-11-14 15:27:59","vector":[0.0291588235,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2089666667]}

Beth combines changing your relationship with food while inspiring you to create amazing clean eating dishes. She was super flexible with my crazy schedule and throughout work trips, a family vacation to Europe, and planning my sister's wedding I was able to stay on track and continue towards my goals with Beth. I finished my time with Beth about 3 months ago and didn't want to review until I was positive that the wonderful things she taught me would stick. They have. I have remade the recipes that Beth taught me in my cooking class with her and have created tons of new amazing clean dishes on my own from what I've learned from her. When I grocery shop I use all the tips and tricks she taught me during our grocery store classes and know what is going to keep me on track. Beth's program is a lifetime change for the better. She teaches you everything you need in small manageable steps. She has instilled a passion for creativity with food and an understanding of what foods fuel you specifically. There's no \"one program fits all\" with Beth. She is invested in you as a person and helping you achieve everything you want out of life.

I ordered the kids Mac and cheese for her, and the baked potato soup and half grilled cheese sandwich for myself. Everything seemed fine until halfway through my soup when I stirred it. I picked my spoon up confused at what I was looking at, and realized it was a long piece of cellophane. A huge piece of plastic just mixed into my soup. Thankfully it was my food, and not in my 2 year olds. How does that even happen? I won't ever return here.","date":"2015-04-17 20:25:13","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We should have taken them up on their offer to move us to a side table after we had started on our salads, but we didn't know any better:))  We both had the chicken golden curry which came with a salad and soup.  The salad was OK and the soup was tasty.  Though the chicken looked appetizing, I was a bit disappointed--it lacked a certain pizzazz.

So this review is from my experience over the span of a year & some change. The service is usually pretty bad, some times to the point where we say we wouldn't go back. But living in Manayunk leaves your options pretty slim. The bartenders are mostly awful. The red head is always miserable looking. And guy who is usually bartending with her is really bad. He will ignore you trying to get his attention while he holds conversations with other customers. Also, he will very obviously grab or slap the red head bartender's ass right in front of everyone. And since she never smiles I can't tell if she's happy about it or not. But it's incredibly unprofessional and frankly, sexual harassment. So, he's a creep. Now onto the food- it's ok. It's overpriced. They have two vegan options: a salad, or sweet potatoe fries. (Insert the emoticon of me shooting myself). Last night when I was there, they were out of veggie burgers. Awesome. When I was just vegetarian and not vegan, there were obviously a few more options, but not much. And risotto for $18?! And that's without adding any of the protein up charges. My boyfriend eats meat so he can order anything. He loves the filet tip sandwich and a couple other things. Overall, I don't enjoy going here simply because, just like the rest of Manayunk (for the exception of Couch Tomato & Taqueria), there are awful options for people who don't eat meat!

Pulling up the the old-fashioned strip mall, I got excited. I love these kinds of \"neighbourhood\" places! \n\nWhen my guest and I walked in, we were greeted by Giuseppe, the patriarch of the family that owns and operates the restaraunt. Shortly after, one of \"his kids,\" came over and explained that we could order off of the chalkboards at the front of the restaurant. Every day, their pasta special is a mere $10(!). All other pastas are $14, and the special of the day was $18. \n\nMy friend and I each ordered the daily special (chicken parmigiana), and some wine ($13\/half litre). The food arrived very quickly, and was not only generously portioned, but steaming hot. It was delicious: the chicken was very tender and flavourful, topped with a tangy homeadede tomato sauce. The pasta was beautifully cooked and seasoned very well!\n\nI couldn't pass up dessert, once I learned that the old family recipe for tiramisu ($6.50) was on the menu. It was a great choice, and one of the best tiramisu I've ever had, if not the best. \n\nTheir capuccino ($2.50) was perfectly made, and had a wonderful cloud of foam on top. It was the perfect accompaniment to the tiramisu!\n\nEven better than everything mentioned above, however, is the laid-back ambiance of the restaurant. This place has spectacular food, but that hasn't gone to the owners' heads. It's entirely unpretentious, and I truly felt comfortable there, like I was sitting at a table full of family.\n\nUltimately, the warm, generous hosting made my guest and I feel totally welcome at Cafe Amore, and the food was so good that we'd come back even if it hadn't.

He brought the manager over, who offered me the menu again.\nI then tried the fried egg and sausage dish - my only other breakfast food-type option. When it arrived, the manager never came back over to check on it. The only bright side there was that I was saved the awkwardness of telling him that I didn't like the second dish either. Totally lacking in flavor, again, and the sausage was the consistency of ground beef - not a good texture for the meal. \nWhen the check arrived, I saw I had been charged for the second dish - the more expensive of the two.\n\nFor a place that tells you upon seating that it's run by a celebrity chef, it was overpriced, provided poor service, and served bland food.

Indeed there was and hypothetically if calls are recorded she would have been proven wrong.  Rather then attempt to apologize or make corrections or give a credit or any customer service satisfaction, I was just  granted silence.  It's determined I will never order from here and encourage any potential customers not to patronize a business who doesn't respect their customers or have customer service skills.

The luncheon express menu is edible, although, as expected, it's a lot of fried meats covered in sauce. Whatever.  Good enough for what you can expect from a place named Chopstix.\n\nToday was a different story. I mean, Chopstix, don't put something on the menu if you don't even have the basic ingredients to make it!  I ordered a Chow Mein today, trying to expand from my usual fried meat covered in sauce with 1\/2 1\/2 lo mein and fried rice, plus it's Sunday and they don't do the Luncheon express menu. I figured chow mein should be right up their alley.  It's typically (even at the real Chinese places who've gotten a little bit lazy) flash fried thin egg-based noodles that you coat with a stir fry of meat\/veggies\/sauce. You get a great cripsy outside while the sauce seeps into the center noodles and make them a good kind of soggy, loosening them up. But, that's not how Chopstix does it. \n\nListen closely Chopstix: chow mein does not equal fried wonton skin strips. Fried wonton skin strips do not equal chow mein.  I got a stir fry of the meats and vegetables and sauce as expected, and a side bag of fried wonton skin strips. I seriously thought they had sent some as appetizers until I realized what was going on. Really? 1. Fried wonton skin strips have a terrible texture when soaked in sauce and soggy. 2. You call this dish chow mein and yet there is no actual mein at all in the dish? Come on! I have no words.\n\nSticking to luncheon express from now on.

Loved the location when it was World of Beer so why not, right?\n\nJust a small crowd so we were able to grab a prime spot outdoors and were immediately waited on by our server. She was just friendly enough without being disinterested which works for me. The Mexi Mule was exactly what I needed - served ice cold in a copper Mule mug and very refreshing. I just wish the habanero syrup was a little more prevalent because I really couldn't taste any spice to the drink whatsoever. My guy ordered up the American Pie which is a combo of apple pie moonshine, Fireball and hard cider. I think the bartender went a little heavy on the Fireball though and it became overpowering. His drink was garnished with a couple of 100 proof cherries which he didn't care for but I loved - even got a couple extra from our server because I dropped one of his.\n\nThe food menu is really sparse which was disappointing but we managed to find something to munch on: the Nosh Board. I'm a lover of charcuterie and admittedly the Nosh Board is NOT advertised as charcuterie but it was disappointing and dull. Pretty sure there were just 2 cheeses (a cheddar that was a bit mild and what seemed like a soft mozzarella), an average salami, shaved ham, olives, grapes, pepperoncinis and couple of slices of bread drizzled in balsamic. The cheeses were dull, the meats tasted like they were from Fry's deli and the grapes were squishy. Wish they'd put more effort in to the dish and make it more interesting and flavorful.\n\nAll in all, it was a great place to hang out for an hour to watch the rest of the game and relax. I'm sure we'll be back.","date":"2018-06-07 18:04:08","vector":[0.0237965517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3481]}

It is a great price, it's fast and the crust, hands down, is the best pizza crust I've ever had. It's fresh, it's crispy, it's chewy, it's even good the next day cold. It's thick but not too thick, not too greasy, not too dry and absolutely PERFECT.\n\nThe hours of Hot Pizza are unbelievable - these guys are pretty much open whenever you need them to be. The location leaves a little to be desired, but at least it's central and there's a parking lot (which is nice, being downtown). I've never had them deliver (only pick up) but I know these services are offered.\n\nThey offer pizza in three sizes (medium, large and extra large) and also pizza by the slice (all though I can't vouch for it). Service is fast and the quality is consistent. If you are looking to bust out of the chain pizza cycle, definitely give these guys a try.","date":"2013-03-27 17:18:34","vector":[0.128132,0.0,0.0,0.4215,0.0]}

We got there around 7:30 or so and I think we were only the third table in there. For such a huge place it seemed a little weird, but I guess wednesday nights aren't that popular? We were debating between this place, cheesecake factory and CPK, all within about 100 feet of eachother, and chose this one since neither of us had been here before. We were both saying how the one at Harrah's in Vegas is always so packed that we never went, and we should go check out a menu.\n\nWe walked in and asked for a menu, the hostesses gladly gave us one and seated us when we said we were ready.  There was no wait since the place was empty. There were a few tables of all girls there, which surprised me until I learned that ladies night was starting soon. I guess if we would have got there about 15 minutes later we would have had to pay a cover charge?? Not really sure how i feel about that.\n\nI ordered a dos equis amber, my boyfriend got a beer, forget which one. His was the big size and came in a mason jar, just like the \"I love this bar\" song. Made me laugh out loud. Mine came in a normal glass sans-lime. Not sure how they expect you to drink XX without a lime, but ok. For our food, I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with the sweet tater tots. My boyfriend got a bacon cheeseburger per the usual. He loved his, he kept saying that it was so good for a $10.00 burger. My pulled pork was ok, it could have been warmed up more. The tots...I wasnt a fan, and i usually love sweet potato fries. They had cinnamon and sugar, and it didn't really compliment my already sweet bbq pulled pork.  I did try some of his fries, they were really yummy!\n\nWhen we got the bill, I saw that his beer was $9 and mine was $5. Not sure that they were worth that, but oh well, a lesson learned for next time.  The bright side was our server was very attentive and she was really sweet too. I usually get a douchey vibe (yes I believe girls can be douchey) from waitresses that have to dress slutty (hooters, etc) but she was cool. She kept asking if we needed anything and offered refills, ranch, etc. I gave her a great tip.\n\nWill I go back? Sure. I'm not into the fake-cowboy crowd that often comes to places like this as well as the maverick as it gets later at night, but I think I would come back again earlier or during the day.  I did notice that they have a free meal offered to active military members, which is pretty awesome too.","date":"2013-08-15 23:35:50","vector":[0.1726212121,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3119933333]}

I do like the honey chicken wrap and the fries, while freezer frozen, are tasty etc. \n\nI was there yesterday and had the burger.

They were playing the old country that I grew up on and the new stuff - so I really enjoyed it!  \n\nAs much as I enjoyed the atmosphere and love of country music, the drinks seemed expensive and the music almost too loud.  It was hard to carry on a conversation and when I left I felt like I was yelling - scratch that - I didn't feel like I was yelling, I was.  \n\nI will definitely be back when I am in the mood for some country western dancing!","date":"2013-01-28 03:25:59","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.61215,0.0674333333]}

I always find two I like, and leave the third. \nThis may seem odd, but Boca reminded me of a Rick Bayless type place, in the premise that you start from home-made top-quality ingredients and the food is guaranteed to taste good.  (Sounds simple, but I can count on one hand the places in town that follow that.) \nDo be warned: sometimes the chef both takes the orders and cooks, so it can be a wait. And the inside is fairly simple and small.  You get served on plastic sheets not plates, eat with your hands kinda place.  Slightly pricier than taco trucks, but cheap if you consider the quality and the chef's skill.  I'm going back for sure!

Not good at all.\nFor dinner recently:\nI got the Mekenah (lamb in ketchup sauce is what it ended up being). It was about 13$. Nothing interesting at all about the dish. Lamb was cooked okay. Texturally uninteresting. Flavors were just not developed. I also got to taste my boyfriend's chicken kabob which was the driest thing ever and also lacked seasoning. I also got to taste my friend Will's combo kebob plate and the lamb was cooked well and juicy on it, all the other meats on the kebob plate was underseasoned.\nAlso the waiter bothered me.

As we arrived, we each were met with a small cup of Bedouin coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker, so I handed mine to the boyfriend, but I was assured that it was delicious. Apparently, coffee before the meal is a Bedouin custom, so it was nice to learn some cultural things at dinner.\n\nFor appetizers, we had hummus and sambosas. The hummus was outstanding! In fact, I've had that during each of my return visits! The sambosas were vegetarian, filled with veggies and lentils. I wasn't crazy about them - they were ok - but others liked them. There were sauces on the side.\n\nMy entree was the vegetarian beriani. I love when any veggie dish includes lots of chickpeas rolling around, and this didn't disappoint. The vegetables were delicately spiced, and the dish came with mounds of rice - I made two more meals out of the leftovers.\n\nI've since returned twice to Al Waha - including once with a large Hot Sauce certificate - and enjoyed my meals both times. \n\nService was fabulous for the group - they really took care of us and explained a lot about the food and the culture. They also made it easy to split the checks according to couples and pay separate bills. During the return visits, though, the service was quite a bit slower, even when there weren't many tables of diners. \n\nAl Waha is smoke free until about 9 p.m., when they bring the hookahs out.

I miss my son-in-laws cooking so I was looking for a local place where I could get good Filipino food.  The pancit was lacking a bit in flavor.  The Adobo flavor was ok, I am just not a fan of tiny chicken bones in my food, but I do realize this is the traditional way Chicken Adobo is made.  The skewered pork was so over cooked I had to cut it off the skewers so I was super disappointed in that purchase, the meat was so tough I had to throw it away.\n\nNow, the store is a different story.  Shelves filled with traditional Filipino foods.  They also have a very decent selection of frozen foods.  The young woman who helped me make my purchases was very nice and very helpful.

This Saturday they had a few guys playing music and they were really good. The food is served out of a hot bar and a room temperature case that held the fried fish, egg rolls, and chicken skewers. I ordered a lunch combo and two chicken skewers. This was way too much food, but I wanted to try a few things. Everything I enjoyed, but my company said it was solid Filipeano food. A comment that was made was that sometimes the amount of fat cut away is a variable you see in Filipeano food. Her mom cut away a lot of the fat. I can see that. I will say fat = flavor, but it's not too great for your waistline.

We're by the door picking out a flavor for the three of us.  So we've decided that Florida key lime was the only one that looked appealing.

I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.  If it were a cat, would we have been able to get a bloody key lime cupcake to go without having to be booted out to their stoop?\n\n1. She says it's the Philadelphia Health Department policy.  Fair enough, BUT then why did it matter if it was a cat or not?  It sure as hell was not a service animal.  If the first thing she said was, \"I apologize, but we don't allow animals,\" this place would be okay in my book. Nope, she wanted to know the species first.  So what pissed me off was the way she framed it.   She had a discriminatory tone.  That was the deal breaker.\n\n2.  She says we can wait outside (in the rain) and she'll bring the stuff out to us.

My friends and I went to pick up our chicken sandwiches after waiting a LONGGGG week, so the excitement had been building up. However, we were left very disappointed. \nWe were met with terrible service at the beginning. We were the only ones waiting to put down our names to pick up our orders, and the cashier refused to take our orders for about 15-20 minutes as she continued to pack up chicken for other individuals. While I understand they were busy, it took about 30 seconds to enter our names. We waited another 20 minutes before receiving our chicken and she did not even give us a bag. She brought out 4 containers and tried handing it to us, after we had watched her pack fewer boxes away into bags earlier. \nNow onto the food! It was okay, it was not worth the 14 dollars. We ordered 2 hots and 2 mediums. The medium was good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't special. The bun was soft, the pickled veggies were good, and the chicken was crispy. The hot sandwich was HOT. It was a slow burn that continued to add up until you were sweating! However, it did not have the pickled peppers as promised on the sandwich. Which in addition to the customer service, bumps the review to a 1 star. I do not think I'd come back to Matty's Hot Chicken because I believe I could get something similar with better customer service for cheaper.","date":"2021-05-23 22:47:10","vector":[0.1326086957,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

There was considerable free parking around, in their own lot, and along the street. When I arrived before my customer, I was greeted by Sasha, a very warm and welcoming young lady who introduced me to the Slim and Husky's experience. She did a fantastic job of perpetuating the anticipation of how good this was going to be. First impressions and all that, right on target. When my customer arrived, we got in the line that probably consisted of 15 people there for lunch like us. Immediately a couple of young ladies who indicated that they were regulars, knowing it was our first time, raved about how big of a treat we were in for. Adding fuel to this anticipatory fire. When we got to the head of the ordering line, we were greeted by the first lady who pulled a crust down and began to build our pizza, starting with sauce. Much like a burrito or sandwich bar, your pizza gets passed down the line adding all the wonderful, fresh ingredients that you like. And there was no lack of selection. Everyone involved in building our \"semi-rectangular\" thin crust pizzas were friendly and contributing to the experience. Once we sat down and our names were called, here came the moment of truth. All I can say is, this was a flavor hit like no other. It was like a taste explosion in your mouth!

However I will say...\n\nHer french cruelers are something like I've never tasted before - they're light and airy and moist and crisp and adorned with delicious flavors like cardamon or coconut hibiscus.\n\nHer Old Fashioned donuts are similar to a cake (if I have to compare them to something) but their also not comparable to any other cake donut you've ever had.  \n\nHer yeast are o so delicious, but appear in rare form as they take a lot more work and space to prep than any others.\n\nThe Fritters, if the heavens shine down on you and you are lucky enough to get your hands on one of Amanda's Apple Fritters... crisp edges, chewy insides, loaded with cinnamony apples, a sticky glaze, and flaky salt.

As others have mentioned, the Mistake roll is great if you like fried rolls. Typically, I would recommend the Beef Negimaki appetizer as well, but last time I was there, the beef was bit overcooked. However, the special appetizer, which included salmon, tuna, and scallops with tropical fruits, was delicious. Their tuna rolls are also consistently fresh and tasty.\n\nI do recommend that you stick to the sushi menu, though. I've only tried venturing onto the dinner menu once, and the Katsudon  I ordered was WAY overcooked. So order a dinner at your own risk!\n\nI have to disagree with reviewers who have said they get bad service. We typically get fantastic service, and the hostess always remembers us and greats us enthusiastically when we arrive, which makes you feel a little like a celebrity.\n\nThe only other downside I feel obligated to mention is that the parking lot there can be really crowded.

I am only rating 1 star because there is not an option to rate them negative stars :)  Made an online order last night for my team at work --- I was feeding my team for our end of quarter as a thank you...and boy did this experience make for a challenge!  It's easier collecting debt than collecting a pizza from this place.  Placed my order the night before w\/delivery time for 12PM next day (today). At 11:42AM, I received a text stating that my order was out for delivery.  Keep in mind that the Pizza Hut is probably only 7 minutes from my work location.  At 12:02PM, I called the number for the store to get a status as to where the pizza driver was.  Phone rang and then was placed into their hold advertising.  Sat on hold for 11 minutes and 23 seconds until I had my coworker also dial while I sat on hold.  She dialed and you could tell someone picked up but sat the phone on the counter as you could hear them shuffling stuff around....she left the line open and I hung up and redialed.  You could hear the phone ringing on the other end as it was now me calling the location.  Was not answered, just placed on the hold again.  So I hung up and dialed again -- this time, he picked up.  You could tell that the guy lacked enthusiasm for being at work!  I swear he sounded like he smoked out before he came to work --- could barely understand him.  Told him about my issue and asked where the pizza was.  Said he could call the driver but that it was first come, first service.  Advised I placed my order last night --- he said the driver had 2 deliveries including mine and they were on opposite sides of town.  Explained I wanted to know where the pizza was.  He put me on hold and NEVER came back on the line!!!  I had my coworker call again --- placed her on hold.....so she redialed....he picked up --- told him that he was supposed to update us on driver location\/pizza status.  He said 'Oh Yea...he'll be there'.  So she asked when would he be coming or how much longer and he put her back on hold then came back onto the line to tell her \"Oh, his tire popped\"...so he could cancel the order.  I grabbed the phone and explained to him that I needed to speak w\/a manager as this experience was absolutely AWFUL.  He said nobody there but himself.  I explained in as calm of a voice that I could that this experience was unacceptable and that I needed him to refire the food and I expected to be credited for this given the experience.  He said to give him 20 minutes and he'd remake the food and give it free.  My entire 5 person team carpooled to Pizza Hut to pick up the food.  When we arrived it wasn't ready so we had to wait about 7 minutes.  The guy was as enthusiastic in person as he was on the phone :P  The place was empty and was only him working --- phone kept ringing and he was placing on hold.  Now I know why placed on hold so much because severely understaffed! If I were him, I think I would've walked out on the job.  Gave us our pizza and showed me that he cancelled the order on the computer since he said he was unable to give me a receipt to show that my order would be credited.  So hopefully I'm not billed as that will be another conversation w\/this place.  I will be reporting this experience to the Pizza Hut corporate once I look into their contact information as well as their FB page.  From the looks of it, this place has some BIG improvements to make w\/experience since only rated 1.5 stars.

I recall waiting in line of two\/three people in front of me and the cook kept going in and out of the door and it was kind of regrettably uncomfortable moving around in the already small area, and I was blocking the small (and only, apparently) garbage that was already up to the brim in food. The food took about 10 minutes to make, and I was asked again what I ordered since there's really no process of keeping track of the orders. We ordered chicken and pork, and it wasn't until after we paid that the cook informed us that there was no chicken and we got ribs instead and I ordered green beans on the side but I got mac and cheese (which I'm not usually a fan of, but it was really good with the bbq sauce!). They didn't charge us the price difference, which was nice (not sure if this was intentional.) and the food itself was nice and filled us up.

Finally, the young kid playing guitar outside the library door needs to head down to Soulard or CWE - Libraries are not places for you to try out bad music in hopes of getting tips of some chic's phone number, dude, really.","date":"2011-07-20 12:48:42","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

It is hard to even know what they are trying to do here. The place has like three different restaurant options this tiny space.

Apparently there are either multiple owners in this place or multiple cooks\/chefs because they have an ATL Wings menu and a menu for J's Chicken and Waffles - Uhh WTF.\n\nI went there for lunch today with my coworker. The first problem is the place had very poor ventilation and you could feel the grease in the air. The smell of fried food was so strong that my shirt still contains the smell a few hours later. The second problem is that I order first, which was a 15 piece order of wings. I wanted to have less wings and a salad on the side, but they don't appear to have salad. My co-worker tried to order the same thing, and the gentleman informed him that he only had enough wings to make the 15 and maybe 6 more on top of that (oooook).\n\nMy coworker ordered some tenders.\n\nThe wings were awful. They were almost cooked right but the sauce was terrible. The ranch dressing that the guy brought me with them was clearly out of a store bought bottle, it was gross. My coworkers food looked like it came straight out of a frozen bag, and he confirmed the taste of the food matched.\n\nThe guy behind the counter was quiet and not overly accommodating. The decor of the place is weird and super low budget, but it was clean at least. I have to say it might have been one of the worst meals I have eaten in some time.\n\nFINALLY - my bill came to $14.86, when he ran my card it came back with a charge off $15.87.

However, this bowl was pretty much flavorless and not worth the hype. The portion was extremely small, and the granola was flavorless as well. They also only had one type of bowl, opposed to places typically offering many variations of pitaya and acai. Once again the portion was a joke and it was very bland compared to ALL places on the west coast that sell these bowls. I do not recommend. Very hyped up and disappointing. I guess since it is one of the first smoothie bowls offered in Nashville people think its a big deal. Overpriced. And also the atmosphere is very uncomfortable. Only one small table for sitting down in an oversized area and kind of scary.","date":"2014-11-04 18:23:39","vector":[0.11581,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I had heard about it and love the concept, but live in Mount Juliet and am rarely in Green Hills.  I was greeted right away and all of the staff was extremely friendly (unfortunately not something I normally experience on that side of town).  Someone walked me through how it all worked, and pointed out their favorite meals.  I decided to try 4 of them (salmon, stuffed chicken, bison chili, and filet), plus their specialty Pitaya Bowl.  The Pitaya bowl was excellent, and I took half home to share with my husband.  We ate the 4 meals over the next few days - they had 4 days of shelf life remaining when I purchased them.  With a new baby at home, we were both grateful for a quick, healthy dinner option, and really liked them.  I saw some of the negative reviews, but all of the ones we tried were very good.  Not as good I'm sure as something that had just been cooked at a restaurant, but very good nonetheless.  Filling, with a good mix of protein and produce, and just the right amount of calories for a light dinner (they averaged about 400 calories each).  The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  I ended up spending $60 for 4 meals, the yogurt bowl, plus a tip (since there was a spot for tip on the receipt?).  So basically for the price of 4 meals at an average sit-down restaurant, I got 4 meals with a lot less food (and less calories too) than I would have gotten eating out.  It seems I chose the most expensive options though, they had others that were cheaper.  They also had a clearance shelf for meals that expired sooner, so I might try those next time.  \n\nps... please set up shop in MJ!!  We desperately need a healthy, non-chain food option.  There's actually quite a bit of disposable income over this way just waiting for the right place to spend it.  =)","date":"2014-10-22 20:41:48","vector":[0.093128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0857666667]}

There was plenty of parking thanks to the shopping center the restaurant is located in.\n\nOnce we were seated we were given, chips, a hot and mild salsa and our water.   The chips were room temperature and tasted OK (they don't taste or look like they are made there).  The salsas were pretty good.\n\nWe ordered some of the regular margaritas.  They were made with Jose Cuervo which I'm not a fan of but I've yet to find any place in town that actually puts decent tequila in their 'top shelf' margarita.  Usually you're better off ordering a shot and a beer, IMHO.\n\nUnfortunately the margaritas were all mix and no tequila.   Neither of us tasted or felt the margaritas we were served so that was disappointing ($6.50 per margarita).\n\nMy wife ordered the fish tacos and I ordered a chimichanga (shredded beef) without any rice and beans.   Our meals came out very fast, almost too fast but that was OK, we were hungry.     My wife's plate was WAY too hot - so hot that the tacos were inedible for about 10 minutes.   My chimichanga was at a good temperature and covered in cheese. It was cut up which was a little weird as I honestly prefer it as a 'whole' burrito.\n\nThe first thing I realized was that the meat was extremely salty.  Not so much that I couldn't eat it but very salty nonetheless.   \n\nThe fish tacos lacked cabbage which is usually a staple with them which was unfortunate.\n\nAll in all however, it wasn't too bad and the service was excellent.

The hotel was beaitiful, clean & well cared for 4 star worthy for that. Rooms were nice, good toiletries, complimentary hbo & newspaper, very comfy bed and quality bedding. The shower took nearly 20min for water to warm up. I hated how loud the room was, I could hear word-for-word telephone conversations from both rooms on either side of me! And was woken by the elevator, ice machine, people in the halls numerous times. Door had a half inch crack all the way around letting in light, sound & cold. Room was chilly, thank goodness I brought my own electric blanket. The room had individual thermostat-awesome except the gigantic air return sounded like a low flying jet!! And to top it off city workers decided to spend the evening on my 2nd night jack hammering pavement to rip out the waterline from 10:30pm-3am ish (right outside my room!) So no sleep AND no water to shower,  brush teeth, wash face...When I called the desk I got an attitude and was told \"sorry its city workers we can't control what they do.\" Then this morning, still no clean water, nor did staff offer us or provide us with any clean water.

I looked around on yelp, and found Indigo. The room for a Saturday night, booked the day before, was reasonably priced for being a really central location. The hotel is cute enough, and small, but for some reason the lobby smells like lemongrass, and not in a good way. The bed was super fluffy and we slept comfortably though. I really dug the layout of the bathroom with the exception of the slatted door. (um, awkward?) They supplied Aveda products, which I happily stuffed in my bag. The hotel staff was helpful enough, and pointed us towards middle-of-the-night-burritos two blocks over. There is a bar and restaurant too, but we didn't try it. We did use the \"phitness\" room, which was small and just functional enough. On the downside, the whole hotel seemed a little cramped; we had to march through a dining area to get to the workout room. The bar was tiny as well. Walking in felt like intruding on a private business meeting for drunk suits. I could hear people in the next room, or leaving the elevator throughout the night as well. Another reviewer wrote about the \"weird design,\" and I got it right away. It's the like idea of a boutique hotel was given to people tasked with recreating it without the originality and with cheaper materials. The colors were kind of clashy and unpleasant after a while.

Huge parking lot, not scary at all.  \n\nThe man working in the warehouse was very nice and willing to show us where specific candy was located.  I was on the hunt for some candy cigarettes (because I am super cool like that).  After a quick walk around the place (and down memory lane) we checked out with a carton of \"smokes\" and some sour straws.\n\nPrices here are less than Sam's and Costco.  They have all sorts of concession candy, fundraising candy, mints, gum, individually packed chips\/cookies, candy toys... I think this is definitely a place to go before Halloween candy shopping or if you just crave sugar like me.\n\nThe man working was so happy we came and was shocked that we even knew about the place.  They really are one of the best kept secrets in St. Louis.  Located between Kingshighway and Morgan Ford in South St. Louis.","date":"2016-01-28 19:31:45","vector":[0.0212470588,0.0,0.0,0.30155,0.0365363636]}

The prices are better then those you'd find a Sam's or Costco. \n\nThe entire time I was browsing inside GCC, the song Candy Man by Sammy Davis Jr. was playing in my head. \n\"Alright everybody, gather around The Candy Man is here\nWhat kind of candy do you want?\nSweet chocolate? Chocolate walnut candy?\nGum drops? Anything you want\nYou've come to the right man because\nI'm the Candy Man\"\n\nGCC has every imaginable kind of candy. They have the popular names like Twix & Payday and names I'd forgotten, but loved as child; 5th Avenue, Zagnut and Zero. You'll also find sugar free candy, Laffy Taffy, Pez, nostalgia candy and bulk candies for your wedding. I'm coming back to buy my Halloween candy here. If your organization is looking for a way to raise funds, General Candy can help you with that as well. \n\nIf you have a sweet tooth for candy, you owe it to yourself to go and check GCC out.

This is not a family sit-down place. It's a hole in the wall.\n\nThe shrimp po-boy and fried chicken were standouts. The fried chicken was wonderfully spiced and cooked. A little small but delightful. The po-boy tasted great and messy. Everything went with the sweet potato fries and chipotle mayo.\n\nI wasn't super excited about the pulled pork or fried green tomatoes. The pulled pork was a little too sweet for my liking and the tomatoes were overcooked.\n\nI desperately wanted to give this place a 4.

I ordered half of a muff\\uleta and a cup of gumbo, which were served with the Sweet Potato Fries. The Gumbo was seasoned well and perfectly textured - not too thin, not too thick.\n\nThe muffuetta tasted pretty good as well, but featured an olive tapenade rather than the olive salad served on the more traditional muffalettas in New Orleans. Still, I'm stoked I can get a tasty muffaletta when I'm craving one here in Edmonton.\n\nI look forward to trying a Po' Boy here one of these days or one of the prix-fix brunches that Danielle, the owner, hosts periodically.

The fact that they had a wide variety of Italian cuisine from pizza to pasta to antipasti and more is what sold me more than anything.\n\nI ordered the margherita pizza, lobster ravioli and their chicken and quinoa balls and eggplant balls. As a non red meat eater, I loved that they had options beyond the traditional meatball. They also have a variety of sauces for you to choose from to appease any palette. I chose the Columbus sauce with mine-- this was described as a Marsala like sauce. It was a little thick and floury for my taste, but that could've have just been because I wasn't eating it in house. The ravioli was delicious and I was pleasantly surprised that the lobster ravioli was full of lobster. This is always a hit or miss item for me as some places try to skip on the lobster, but not Sociale. They pizza was amazing as well. \n\nI'm only giving 4 stars because when I tried to call in my order, I had to call many times before I could get anyone on the phone to take my order, but I will certainly be back.","date":"2018-07-08 13:34:26","vector":[0.0764619048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0999]}

After sitting outside for about 5\/7 minutes with no server we went inside to find a seat at the bar. \n\nWe started off with some craft cocktails which were very good. Then placed our food order. The food came out at different times which was odd to me. First the pizza, then side of veggies, then salad, then meatballs. All we're very good, especially the margarita pizza with fresh basil and the meatballs. We tried all 4 types of balls, eggplant and beef were my favorite. The salad was unorthodox in my opinion; 5 individual large romaine leaves.  They were out of pasta fagioli which I was really excited to try. \n\nWe switched to wine after our cocktails. And finished our meal with some cannolis. Overall was great food. \n\nI was impressed with the food and drinks.

After reading some reviews, I decided to try Don's as it sounded like he was just what I was looking for.\n\nYou do not need an appointment, which was a plus for me and I found that the first come first served worked out well here as there was never more than one or two ahead of me, and sometimes no wait at all.\n\nDon has been doing this for many years and is one of the older barbers from the \"Old School\" and does it the way many of us remember how a hair cut was supposed to be done. There was no rush or any attempt to get you out fast. His attention to detail was very refreshing.\n\nDon is in a very small shop and has been here for many years. It is a little hard to find as it is not in or around other stores. Most of his business is from repeat customers who know where he is.\n\nDon's price is still $14 as he has to keep his price competitive to try to stay in business and keep up with the competition. I always leave him a big tip, as I know it would cost much more other places, but more importantly, I know he really could use it and does deserve it.\n\nI hope many others will give Don's a try so we can keep older experienced people like Don in business.","date":"2019-07-25 21:24:02","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0738583333]}

The food looked great and reviews were pretty good so we decided to give it a try.\n\nI really enjoyed the design of the restaurant--low lighting, dinner by candlelight, large illuminated bar, black walls with painted writing from floor to ceiling (a definite cute date night mood). \n\nOur server was friendly, but kind of an over seller on the food, maybe a little used car salesman-like and definitely not very attentive.\n\nThe cocktails were a bit unbalanced and one note and the food although gorgeously plated definitely disappointed.\nTo start the meal we got BBQ shrimp as an appetizer, it was very good and the sauce was delicious, although I was surprised to see the shrimp out of the shell because it is not typically made that way (the shell soaks up all that flavorful sauce) and I kind of missed the at in the dish.\nFor entrees husband got the filet which came out pretty close to ice cold and a bit undercooked. I got the pork chop, which was so pretty and seasoned well but still a bit underwhelming. The sides that accompanied the entrees were also lacking-- who could really eat that much meat with little to no side on the plate. We also got the carrots which were spiced with harissa, they were pretty good. Overall we left hungry and unsatisfied.","date":"2021-11-06 15:05:18","vector":[0.0913,0.0,0.0,0.07034,0.0262833333]}

It can be a little difficult to find do to limited signage but once you do locate the restaurant you will not be disappointed by the environment. Next their drink menu is amazing especially if you are a wine drinker. They do have a few mixed cocktails on the menu as well. And I'm pretty sure you can have the bar make you a mixed drink if you want. Now to the food. I know this restaurant odd fairly new and you can tell. The waiter had limited knowledge of what each item consisted of when we asked questions. Also there were a few times we were looking for our waiter and saw him standing around talking to other waiters. At one point we did have to ask him to check on our food because we had been waiting over a hour for our entree. But I'll come back to that in a second. For an appetizer we got a charcuterie board. The board was really good. My only complaint was that you can't select what you would like on the board and the waiter didn't explain what each meat or cheese was. We literally were guessing. Now back to the long wait. After we finished our board we had to flag the waiter down to actually put in our order. After waiting over a hour we received cold food. Our $95 porterhouse was even cold in which our waiter told us 10 minutes earlier that was the hold up for our food. Out off all our food we ordered we only received warm fries. That's crazy for the price of the food. The manger did try to make it right by first telling us that he could \"reheat\" our steak but it would take 25\/30 minutes to recon us another steak. I'm sorry but a $95 streak can't be reheated especially when it was already over desired medium cook we requested. Also after waiting over a hour for a meal we didn't have the time to wait another 30 minutes to eat.  The manager ended properly correcting our order. Overall be very aware of this place. The drinks are good and the restaurant has a great vibe but they really got to work on their food. Because even if our food was warm the food didn't taste that great.

Then a young lady went to the fry bin to fill a carton full of fries and placed it in a different brown bag.  Then she returns to the fry bin, takes a 4 x 6 silver pan that was at least 3-inches deep and fill it more fries and then pours that on top of my fry order in the second bag.  I thought my order would be coming but she stood their talking to a co-worker.  After about 3-4 minutes of waiting I was about to blow a gasket when she went to the deep fryer, removed fresh fries, seasoned them, grabbed the silver pan again, refilled it, dumped it into my bag, closed it and handed my order to me.  Holy cow, a single order was half a bag full of fries. I hope this wasn't a fluke because those fries were pretty damn good.

Regardless, my latest visit is my last visit to Panda Express, if I can help it.\nI recently went to their newly opened restaurant on 96th St in the Meijer parking lot...I wasted my money, again.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken pao, and broccoli beef. They both tasted like soap. Honestly, this is the worst chinese food I have ever tasted. I threw most of it away. You only get two entrees and rice for almost $7. I can go to another chinese restaurant and get that along with a side and drink for that price.  In addition, I have determined that Panda Express tastes like plain, make-at-home chinese. In fact, I think I could do better than this. At least I have finally learned my lesson and know for sure that their food will never be improved.

This is not acceptable--they want you to park so their numbers don't look like people waited in the drive thru very long.

I am glad I checked, but then I had to get out of the car and go in (which I was avoiding by going through the drive thru). \n\nThere was a guy in front of me so I waited. He turned around and asked if my order was \"fudged\" up too. I said it was missing a burger. He grumbled about how this location was always \"fudging\" orders up and, I have to agree. Both times my order has been missing something (the first time I didn't know till I got home and I was not going to go back). Guy gets his order and asks to speak to a manager.

No real apology or anything, which would have gone a long way. \n\nI drive home. I open the first wrapper and the \"no mayo\" has worked on one item. Other two have lots of mayo. So after all of the hassle.... part of the order is still wrong. My husband could scrape off the mayo, I hate it and at least the one chicken sandwich was without it.

The harissa sauce was on the saltier side.. it probably would have tasted more balanced if it had a little bit more vegetables. \n\nIt came out at a reasonable speed despite how busy it was. They give you buzzers to know when your order is up. The woman at the register seemed stressed and seemed a bit annoyed with her job. The two cooks appeared a bit frazzled too. \n\nI don't think I would recommend taking the sandwich to go, as the crispy falafel is best eaten ASAP and the sauce would probably make the pita soggy.","date":"2018-03-12 00:31:21","vector":[0.0741428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1060666667]}

She'd been here for lunch before and had a good experience and wanted me to try. It's sort of in the Gulch, at least the edge of it. There is some outside seating with a view of an office building but not much else. The area is improving though, so maybe it'll continue to become a nicer location. It's a trendy spot, with lots of millennials. It's on the noisy side, my sound meter hovering at 85db. The music is a big part, grunge on our visit with plenty of subwoofer. I suspect that a summertime visit might be quieter, as the roll up doors might be open. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We arrived Saturday at 2:00 and were told a 45 minute wait. We walked down the street and 15 minutes later received a text to say it table was ready. Upon being seated, we learned that weekends are brunch only until 3. Our server let us stall for about 30 minutes until we could order from the real menu. The breakfast\/brunch items looked OK, but I wanted a real chance to see their fare. Having lived in Texas and traveled many times to Mexico, I expected to see some authenticity. My expectations were too high. Pork belly and Kim che aren't staples of Mexican cuisine. It seems this place follows the Nashville trend of trying to hard to be gourmet. The salsa was sweet and served warm. I think Laredo Cantina does the same? Probably the same owners. The executive chef's name was on the menu and while I don't recall what it was, it seemed Eastern European to me. It explained a lot. That and the fact I didn't see an employee over 25. I only saw a handful of patrons over 25. We ordered queso and chips as an appetizer to last until lunch. The queso was slightly thick, I'm not sure it wasn't Velveeta, and had a slight off taste. I had to ponder it a bit, but it was onions, a string taste of onions, though no (or very little) flavor from any form of pepper. My wife ordered Chicken Nachos, something hard to mess up. She wouldn't elaborate on the taste, except to say that the whole visit was a mistake. Apparently not the quality she'd gotten before. I ordered 5 Street Tacos, and a side of Street Corn. These are real indicators of Mexican food, as street vendors are common. I was really excited about the chorizo, as it was described as house prepared. I have no doubt it was house prepared, as no supplier of Mexican food would have tried to pass it off as chorizo. I'm about 99% sure I tasted oregano, and about 80% sure the other weird flavor was coriander. It's true blasphemy to believe it could have been of any Hispanic origin. The others were equally disappointing, except for the pork. If you want a pork barbecue taco, this might be a good place for one. The check was $73, and if it had been good, would have been with it. If you consider a restaurant with a sort of Spanish sounding name (a\u00f1ejo is an adjective, meaning aged), expect the food to be sort of Spanish as well, like the chef saw a subtitled Spanish movie once. Review the menu closely online (I assume it's available) and if you're actually knowledgeable about food you'll recognize the mistakes prior to wasting time and money. Leave this one for the trendy folks who don't know better.","date":"2017-01-14 22:41:37","vector":[0.007772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0468333333]}

Returning from a thanksgiving trip to Texas.\n\nThe first time we avoided the place because it was empty, dark, and a little scary looking from the lack of customers that we had seen or not seen visiting the restaurant. Unfortunately we headed to the Denny's next door which was a total disaster.\n\nThe second time we decided to give the place a try because it was either Chickenuevo or Burger King. Yeah, not a very difficult decision to make.\n\nAgain, the place was dead and we felt a little awkward as we were the only customers there on a Saturday evening. We decided to get it to go because it was easier to feed our family of 5 in the hotel room.\n\nThe place was clean, the staff was pleasant and the service was quick. Pricing was cheaper than what we would have paid at any other fast food restaurant so that was a plus.\n\n\nThe food was surprisingly good. The chicken wasn't dry, it had a great taste and the salsas were pretty good as well. We chose the macaroni and whole beans as our sides. The only thing we were disappointed about was that we thought it would be Mac n cheese but it ended up being macaroni salad. That was our mistake as we should have asked prior to ordering. The beans were actually pretty good and had flavor. The guacamole on our chips was good too. My wife said it was too spicy for her but I thought it was tasty. The tortillas were good but I wish they would have given us more. 6 tortillas isn't enough for a family of 5, two of which are under 5 and love tortillas. Oh and they also put a fried jalape\u00f1o in with our chicken which was pretty awesome.\n\nAll in all the experience was good, the food was tasty, and I would definitely consider giving Chickenuevo a try if you are unsure where to eat if you are staying in any of the nearby hotels.

It was a little expensive, but I would be lying if I said I wasn't very satisfied, and it was more than enough for two people.\n\nAfter we finished the salami appetizer, we waited a few more minutes for our pizza, and it was well worth the wait.

My boyfriend compared it to a croissant. The toppings were delicious, well-distributed, and well chosen.
