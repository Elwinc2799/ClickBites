One bite of their Carolina Tacos and I was riding a unicorn with Ron Burgundy all the way to Yumtown.  The boo suggested two Carolina tacos for $3 and I said \"do me on it!\"...\n\nThey must have had a limited menu that day because on their site I'm seeing a whole slew of unique truck bites that I'm dying to try.  During the arts crawl they had three types of tacos and a sandwiched named after Edgar Allen Poe (I think).  The Carolina tacos were pulled pork tacos stuffed to the brim with pulled pork, pickled cabbage, and cotija cheese.  Plus you can fill a little container guy up with tomatillo sauce for additional adventures in Yumtown.  The pork was moist (gross word) and delicious, and the tacos were a bit messy but in a good way.  Sometimes taco trucks just don't give you enough meat.  Yumtown knows a good meaty taco.\n\nThey need to come on down to University City town where I can grab up their bites on a weekly basis.  BTW, if you haven't checked out the Fairmount Arts Crawl it is a must for Fairmounters.  Seriously, I think I was in love with everybody that day and I didn't even do drugs.","date":"2012-04-30 17:24:39","vector":[0.076325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

This delightful sandwich consists of a perfectly toasted baguette filled with roasted sweet potato, hummus, red onions, and a lot more ingredients that work so perfectly even for the non vegeterians. \n\nThe Joy: the pulled pork was not only delicious, but it easily became one of my all time favorite sandwiches from a food truck--actually no, one of my favorite sandwiches anywhere!

We ate breakfast here on a freezing morning between snow storms. So, forgiving me for saying that this place feels cold. On the other hand the wait staff is among the best I have experienced. The others in our party ordered typical egg, potatoes, meat, and toast breakfasts; I ordered the apricot granola pancakes. What I expected was granola and pieces of apricot baked into the pancakes. What I received was four beautiful, fluffy pancakes covered with baked apricot granola. The pancakes were delicious on their own. A little syrup made the pancakes better. Adding the granola pushed them over the top. My only regret was that I could only eat three of the four pancakes. (Our wait-person told me that they do not offer a short stack version.) I stole a piece of bacon from my wife. It was good but a little undercooked for my taste. I like my bacon crisp.\n\nMarch 2018:\n\nIt was cold and windy outside so we retreated to the Roundabout Grill for dinner. I ordered tomato bisque soup and house-made rigatoni. The soup was so good that I was tempted to cancel the rigatoni and get a couple more cups of soup. I am glad I do not do that because the rigatoni was about the best I have ever enjoyed. The flavor balance was excellent with just the right amount of sausage. \n\nThe next morning I ordered the apricot granola hot cakes that I had eaten in January 2017. They seemed a bit drier than the last time. Slightly over cooked? It took a bit more syrup to get them just right but they were as good as I remembered them.","date":"2018-03-17 00:22:22","vector":[0.0971066667,0.4939,0.0,0.0332,0.0]}

For lunch time on a Saturday the wait time wasn't bad, about 15 minutes.  \n\nFirst, the menu doesn't match the decor at all.  I think an upgrade to the interior would make the Cafe more appealing.  But there are a ton of regulars who seem not to mind.\n\nI had a chicken torta and the husband had a ruben.  Both were pretty good and filling.\n\nMy main criticism is the waiter.  We got our food super fast, but when we were done, we sat for about 10 minutes before we had to flag down someone else for our check.  I really felt like we could have left without paying and no one would have noticed.  I WOULD NEVER DO THAT!  I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, but if we have empty glasses, offer a refill.   \n\nIf decor doesn't bother you, the food is great.  The waiter may have been having an off day.

I have no beef with smoking bars, but this place is super smoky.  So much so that my throat hurt badly afterwards.\n\nWe came for the karaoke and left with no karaoke.  The lady in charge took my song request and said that she probably couldn't fit me in.  Then she proceeded to sing the last song of the night.

It is a breath of fresh air to go somewhere and get exactly what you want - no more or less!  And for a fair price (I want to say $7.50) you can get just that at Mongolia Express.  A full bowl for me is at least 2 meals so it`s not a bad deal at all.  So far, I have never had to wait in line - that`s always a bonus!\n\nSometimes it really is the simple things - and a lot can be said for enjoying my favourite dish without worrying about unknowingly biting into a creepily textured water chestnut or something of the sort.","date":"2012-11-20 17:27:34","vector":[0.2382692308,0.5267,0.1909,0.0,0.0]}

We also asked about a table for 6 that was empty, as there were 5 of us, and were told that this table was reserved. When I pointed out that I had called prior the day before and was told that there are no reservations, the hostess just starred at me blankly. Once seated, there was a mix up with the wait staff regarding which waiter was to serve us, no big deal. We ordered drinks, an appetizer, and dinner as soon as that was ironed out, and the waiter was pleasant and apologetic. We asked for bread and got it, drinks came soon and we were off to a better start until 30 min later they brought out clams when we ordered raw oysters, when we explained to the food runner that we didn't order clams, he said that they ran out of oysters and clams was all they had. This was an odd explanation, and we sent the clams back of course. My daughter's Caesar salad was overdressed and had large bits of anchovy, so she didn't eat much of it. After waiting for over an hour for dinner (after we had ordered), my grilled shrimp, and rice on the plate arrived to the table cold and half of the shrimp were burnt. I was hungry and tired, it was late, so I just ate the shrimp and rice. The waiter was apologetic for the wait and seemed to be trying very hard. There were two tables that needed to be cleared nearby almost the entire 2 1\/2 hours we were sitting there with food all over the floor, it was disgusting. I thought to myself that one of the 3 hostesses should have stepped in to help instead of standing around an empty lobby with a sour look on their faces. It's apparently a training issue for the staff and the kitchen. Everyone else's meal was served warm or hot, so mine must have been prepared an hour or so before everyone else's. My daughter's crab cakes had so much red bell pepper, it was almost as if it was red bell pepper she ordered with a garnish of crab. So, she ate 2 bites and came home hungry. My mom was promised her own small birthday cake (since we were there to celebrate her birthday), but that never arrived, and neither did the manager. We ordered dessert since it was her birthday, but I have to say that the key lime pie was so sour most of us couldn't eat more than just the one bite. Bonefish is so much better, as well as the Shrimp Boat. Brandon could really use another good Seafood restaurant however, but this is not one of them. I can understand that in 6 months or so, they will have their routine down and the staff will be trained with all of the kinks out, but for the high price and low quality of the food we won't be coming back.

Here at Beers of the World there is a veggie burger available for those trying to avoid meat. \n\nIt is a store bought patty, probably a garden burger, served on a bun with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and baby greens. It comes with an aioli spread and a vinaigrette on the baby greens. Naturally I axed the aioli, and asked for nothing in the greens. I don't like this new tendency for restaurants to put the worst sauce or spread they can think of on everything. I'd rather have BBQ sauce on this sort of a burger, but settled for ketchup which wasn't half bad. The dish comes with a side of fries, and a pickle. Beware the pickle ruining your food if you don't like them. \n\nAll in all for airport food it was pretty good. They got my order correct: no pickle or sauce of any kind. \n\nOn the downside they play some hideous club music here, so if you don't have a headache from general airport incompetence already, the music will make sure you leave with one.

My favorite is the Bentley and my husband loves the cobb. Salads come with a choice of white or wheat roll which is also very tasty. The staff are friendly and move the line along quickly.\n\nTheir menu can be found online and they do not increase the prices just because you are at the airport!\n\nAbout the Corporate Company:\n\nThe franchise Saladworks is best known for serving made-to-order entr\u00e9e salads. The restaurant also offers other items such as wraps, sandwiches, and soups. There are over 100 restaurants across the US with the majority located in this area because the chain is headquartered in Conshohocken.  In addition to the US, the chain can be found in Canada, Dubai and Singapore.","date":"2018-08-20 01:33:22","vector":[-0.0160384615,0.0,-0.2411,0.0,0.0]}

Even though it is pricey it will last for days, as one slice is very hearty.

The address is somewhat misleading as the entrance is actually off of Rudasill. It will cost you $10 to play 18. You can rent a golf cart for $5 for up to 2 people riding.\n\nThis course is great for long arms. There isn't a short basket on the whole course. Hence for me, who does not possess a long arm, 3.5 stars. It will take you longer to play than on a dedicated disc golf course if you do not rent a cart. There really are not many obstacles for long arm throwers. Yes, there are trees, but there are fairways, and this course is excellent for honing your fairway drives. There is a water hazard for two of the baskets and if your disc lands in the drink, you can go to the clubhouse, plunk down a deposit, and use the golden retriever (which is actually white, in this case). The club forbids anyone from going into the water, so please respect that.\n\nA plus is that there is grass. The website shows pictures of beautiful green grass, but it isn't quite that spectacular. And there still is some dirt around. There is a club house so you can buy drinks and snacks. There is a water fountain to fill up your H2O bottle. And there are clean restrooms.\n\nOne of the rules that the local disc club has for this course is that all the greens are Out of Bounds (OB). I'm sure they have a good reason. I haven't researched it on the PDGA site, but maybe there is a universal rule for it. I think it is silly. That means that for just about every basket on this course, there is an OB, right by the basket. It's not like disc golfers are going to ruin the greens by walking on it or throwing from it. There are not going to be drives but putts made from a green. So I think it is a silly rule.\n\nThey hold tournaments here, so the local disc-ers must like it. I'm sure that there are plenty of disc golfers that would give this 4 or even 5 stars. A couple of my friends would. I just don't like paying to play. I don't like getting behind ball golfers and having to wait as it takes them longer to play the hole than it does for us to play the basket. The ball golfers are respectful and friendly, don't get me wrong, I just don't like sharing a course with them.\n\nEven my long arm buddies don't get too many birdies on this course: I don't get any. There are a couple of baskets where it might be possible and I've come close, just missing my medium or long putt.\n\nMy recommendation is to give it a try. Maybe you will like it way more than I enjoy it. If you are a disc golfer in Tucson, you have to try it at least once.","date":"2016-10-15 18:49:47","vector":[-0.0908571429,0.0,0.0,0.1902357143,0.0]}

There's a reason so many people are enamored with this bright red truck of French goodies. From what I've seen, the food truck market might have an edge on Nashville's brick & mortar scene wrt diversity. Maybe.\n\nWhat's not a 'maybe' is that CaD is serving up terrific food. I was hungry when I got to the truck so eating ASAP was on my agenda. I ran across their offerings at the 12 South Farmers Market and it just so happened that earlier I was chatting up the Hummus Chick (seriously. If you like hummus, find her; her product is tEh awesome\u2122) and she told me that the truck was featuring her hummus in the Java Sandwich. Sold. I wanted to buy some tubs of the hummus, but I had many errands to run before heading home and it was a particularly warm early autumn day. I don't know if hummus spoils but I didn't want to take a chance. What I did want to do, though, was eat a sandwich with that hummus. So it came to pass that I stood in front of the CaD truck... and did not order a crepe.\n\nHowever, I didn't choose wrong. My vegetarian sandwich was a rocking journey of flavor and newness. For all those who think that food truck cuisine is greasy, simple and pedestrian, I challenge you to eat from CaD and keep that mindset.

CaD has a seasonal menu so I'm guessing my Java is a thing of the past but I have enough trust in the brains behind the butter that the current savory and sweet creations are just as fantastic.

I relayed to someone at the front desk my request &  they relayed that to someone in a far back room (I'm assuming where the repairs are done)\n\n   A few days later I  picked up my guitar from the store and as I opened the case I noticed that the vibrato bar was missing .Upon closer it turns out the bar was broken and the majority of the bar had busted off.\n\n     I instantly took the wrecked guitar back into the store and told the person at the front desk what happened. They went and relayed the issue to the repair department.Soon after, the person at the front desk came back and relayed to me that the tech\/luthier said that the bar was screwed in too tight and busted.\n\n   This may`ve been very well true but in my opinion , a music store that wanted me as a return customer would`ve notified me ahead of time that a piece of my  instrument was busted in the repair process. .Soon after that ,the clerk at the front desk told me \"I can sell you a new bar for 8 bucks \"  I suppose he was just doing his job and trying to help but it was not a professional response to someone who just discovered his personal property was damaged . \n\n     Also, I never had the opportunity to speak with the actual tech that did the guitar \"repair\". Was it my job to somehow 'flag down' someone in the repair shop ?\n\n     I left that night feeling as if there was not much interest in keeping me as a customer.\n\n     As a result of this experience ,I plan to venture out to a different place for future guitar repairs where there is a much greater emphasis on personal attention and care to my investment.","date":"2017-06-22 19:50:07","vector":[0.0,0.24695,0.0,-0.0974307692,0.0]}

Way to much mustard. Unless I eat the crisp edges, I barely taste the patties (which are very well done). \n3. Meat to bun ratio: As their original burger comes with two patties, it evens the ration. I did need to consistently eat the edges since the patties were so much larger. \n4. Included extras (veggies \/ condiments): American cheese, dill pickles, white onion and yellow mustard. \n5. Price: $4.69\n\nGrade: C = It's ok. Burger might be a little overdone, but still tastes well enough. If you're hungry, it'll do.

It was bursting with flavor and the calamari was tender and mixed well with the sauce. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to take a picture before the dish was mixed but trust me it definitely looked aesthetically pleasing before mixing. \n\nNext I tried the extra crispy beer-battered KFC. The chicken was crispy, very well seasoned and tasted like the perfect fried chicken. It came with three types of dipping sauce and each one paired well with the chicken. This dish also came with taro fries. They were crunchy and nicely salted. If you like taro, then you would enjoy them. Lastly this dish came with Korean coleslaw and it didn't taste like the usual coleslaw you would expect. It was refreshing to eat with the chicken and the dressing was super flavourful. \n\nOur server told us that their grand opening week is Nov 5-10th and they are having specials with their extra crispy beer-battered KFC so check them out! I will definitely be going back soon to try their other dishes.","date":"2018-10-28 08:09:42","vector":[0.0861347826,0.0,0.0,0.2997,0.0]}

You're highly unlikely to accidentally stumble upon the Barking Dog. It's situated behind the Shell Station on 49th and Penn. a location that prompted me to use the word dreadful. Dreadful for two reasons, first, as I mentioned, it's not likely you'll just happen to find it, you have to be looking for it (thought the bright green awning certainly helps, a little) and second because its less that 100 ft. from Cafe Patachou, which might as well be a cardinal sin in the world of small time Indianapolis eatery's. \n\nHowever, it's defiantly worth looking for. The food was awesome. The Barking dog is the first good thing to blow in from the east coast. Usually they just send us hurricanes and the occasional Patriot fan. But the Nantucket based Barking Dog is a real winner, and while choking on your food is a possibility, choking in a big game is less likely. New England inspired cuisine including fresh seafood dishes and weekly specials all posted on a hand written chalk board gives this place a fresh local feel that one could get used to.\n\nI went with the clam roll. I have to admit, I had no idea what a clam roll was but decided to dive right in. I was pleased to discover that the clam roll was in fact, a mound of fresh, lightly fried clams on a New England style bun. (The purveyors will hopefully forgive me for this description, but a New England style bun is basically a hot dog bun, that is flat on both sides and lightly grilled). The flavor was awesome, the clams were fresh so they had no fishy taste or wild flavor at all, they were super crisp and had no odor or taste of the fryer. They were perfectly cooked and were not even a little chewy, a problem one may often run into with clams. The side choices were chips or slaw, so I of course went with the slaw, because, well chips are chips. The slaw was good and sweet, an obvious New England style slaw. \n\nThe misses had a burger, she always has burgers, she is a burger person and knows the best ones in Indy. She remarked that it was good, really good. Which is a good compliment considering her usual response is...\"Eh, it's ok.\" We also got some pommes frites with chipotle ketchup. I loved the ketchup, and the frites, were...well, I would probably just call them fries. \n\nThe food did take a little long, which I immediately forgave because it tasted so good, I can wait, but it better be worth it. What was less forgivable was the portions. Neither my clam roll nor the burger we're especially large, and the side of cole slaw came in what we call a bullet, which is a 2 oz. metal vessel. We left super happy with the taste and quality of the food, however we agreed that in a few hours we would be hungry again. (Before you assume that we are simply fat, gluttonous, over eaters....don't. We both usually take half our food home from most restaurants).\n\nThe place looks and feels great, and defiantly has a lot of character, and it looks like they spent a good amount to make it look as good as it does. Get out there and try it, because I love it, and I don't want it to leave.\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: To date the Barking Dog is not accepting credit\/debit cards, I was assured that they plan to get a card reader soon, but in the mean time take some cash, or the check book.","date":"2008-09-05 17:22:07","vector":[0.1927090909,0.29295,-0.0270666667,0.13753,0.0]}

I love \"Asian Fusion\" and although it's all pretty westernized here, it's still delicious. Both meat and vegetarian options, with noodles, rice or veggies, and plenty of different sauces, too. I mega-appreciate the nutritional guide online, because there's a huge sliding scale for some of their dishes. Some meals, like the teriyaki stirfry, are actually really good for you! Breaded chicken? Not so much. (OK, I probably could have guessed that one.)\n\nSo why not 5 stars? Well, it's not hyper local, which also bums me out. It definitely feels like a franchise when you walk in - employees that don't seem too committed to the job, sort of a sterile feel to the whole place.\n\nI also feel like the amount of food isn't worth the price. I stopped by for dinner downtown the other night when I was starving but in a hurry.

I am always sure to order broccoli instead of their 'Asian vegetable mix' (the ingredients of which I can't seem to find anywhere online), because I'm allergic to green pepper. My husband and I ordered takeout, since this is the only location in the area that delivers. It took more than an hour, but that was fine. When it got here I checked the receipt- shrimp red Thai curry box, broccoli, and pad Thai box for my husband, perfect. \n\nUnfortunately, my broccoli was nowhere in sight and it was filled with their Asian vegetable mix. I called the store and spoke to an employee who didn't seem to care at all that there had been an issue, explaining I had ordered a shrimp red curry box with broccoli but had gotten a meal I couldn't eat at all. Through the call she treated me like an annoyance and a waste of her time, and eventually asked, \"Well, what do you want me to do?\"...as in \"get over it\" not \"How can I fix this?\" I asked if she could send out my correct order. To the delivery guy's credit, he got there quickly and was very apologetic and friendly. \n\nI went back to my apartment with my curry and opened it to discover it was not what I had paid for- I had paid extra for shrimp, and my replacement was chicken. I'm too tired of incompetence and too hungry to try again, so I'll just forget the shrimp and eat the replacement, but I would be hesitant to order from Wok Box again- orders get messed up, and I understand that, but the attitude of the employee in the store was totally off-putting, and will probably keep me from ever ordering Wok Box as takeout again- I'll pick another location where the employees actually care about their jobs, and eat in.","date":"2013-06-06 03:50:48","vector":[-0.0615928571,0.1646333333,0.0,-0.07025,0.0]}

Filled with pork and just the right about of steam\/pan fried dough. Serve with soy sauce and a little hot schezuan pepper mixture and they were even better. I also tried a spicy fried shrimp dish and was pretty impressed. Not enough heat for me, but the shrimp were huge and perfectly batter cooked. Now the sad part. The happy family was not good. Canned scallops and a weak watery sauce. Would not order again which makes me sad as it is usually my favorite dish. Won't stop me from coming back and ordering more items though.\n\nNow the matriarch at the counter. Think you are busy at your job? Well you aren't. This lady kills it. Taking phone orders, in person take out orders, and cashing people out. She also kept on top of the kitchen and the take out orders without breaking a sweat.

I hadn't been to a \"b-dubs\" in almost 10 years, so I was mildly curious to see if anything had changed. If it has, it has not changed for the better.\n\nThe atmosphere is still the same, generic chain feeling you get from watching the movie Waiting, except without the jokes. The boneless wings were overpriced and tasted no better than anything I could by in a grocery freezer. I ordered Buffalo flavor and it came spiced with dry seasonings instead of a buffalo sauce. Did I miss that on the menu? Was I supposed to be given an option.\n\nThe beer options seemed better than I remember, including some local brews, which earned this visit a second star. Don't expect any deals, however.\n\nOur server was prompt and friendly, which seemed out of place compared to dour looks on the other employees I observed.\n\nThe place has all the charm of your local Kinko's. I should know - I worked at one for two years. My expectations have risen in the last decade after experiencing all the wonderful local spots where you can get fresh, flavorful food at similar prices with great service.\n\nAs far as the fantasy football stuff goes, they did have free wifi and ample wall plugs. The wifi hiccuped a couple of times but didn't affect anyone's pick. They give you a draft kit with a nice, huge draft board and stickers for every player. However, they didn't set us up anywhere special where we had room to actually use it. Each person gets a $10 paper gift card to use on a FUTURE visit on anything but alcohol.

That's not exactly my idea of a fun tradition, but it does give the bar a nice atmosphere and they seem to have a good time. \n\nAnyways, midway thru my game, some crazy stranger walks into the bar and tries to change the TV that my game is on! The owner and all his buddies promptly stands up for us and don't allow they guy to change the channel. So I really appreciated that and it's nice to know I can always come here and be able to watch my game from start to finish.\n\nThe food is your typical bar food but they do run a special that certain sections of the menu are SUPER CHEAP (like $2 for a burger) whenever a home team plays (Rams, Cardinals, Blues).  \n\nThere's several sections to Friendly's but I haven't really explored all of them. As stated before, there's a main bar area with a ton of TV's. There's also an outdoor patio with a \"bags\" game and video game\/pinball machine area.\n\nFriendly's is a great place to go if you just want to have a chill\/casual night or watch your favorite team play. I'll probably be back eventually next time the mood strikes me.","date":"2014-11-30 02:21:32","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.39915,0.08737,0.0]}

One random, caffeine-craving morning, we decided that we wanted some good coffee from a local coffee shop and the Coffee Brake won. We were hoping to have a great experience so that we could incorporate it into our morning routine, but that wasn't exactly the outcome.\n\nThe coffee itself was fine. It didn't really sit well with me, but that could have been the particular kind of beverage that I chose. But along with that, the gentleman owner didn't seem as though he was up for taking our order, offering recommendations or even smiling for that matter. Hopefully he was just having an off day and that's not his usual demeanor with customers. Or maybe it was just us, specifically, but we were smiling and friendly as we usually are so that would be surprising. Either way, it was enough to deter us from repeat visits.\n\nAgain, the coffee itself wasn't bad. It was fresh, hot and tasty.

They have an exceptional deal on wines. If you're not too picky and you just want to pick up a few bottles of inexpensive wine to have around for drinking with dinner or casual entertaining, this is your place. \nYes, it is in a pretty seedy part of Gallatin Road, but every time I've been there, it's been pretty crowded and the staff have been very helpful, even carrying my purchases out to the car for me. I think their wine deal has attracted a new kind of customer. \nLast Thanksgiving, we took advantage of their deal and bought a case of wine for $44, tax included. I don't know of a cheaper price anywhere in Nashville. You can pick 3 wines for 10.99, or pick 12 and receive one free bottle. At the front of the store, there are boxes piled up with the wines included in this deal. \nNow this review comes with a caveat: pick only wines from these front stacks. Don't be tempted to go to the back and pick from the shelves. I learned this the hard way. This is primarily a liquor store, so many of those wines have not sold for perhaps many years and the chances are pretty good you'll pick up a spoiled one.

I ordered roast chicken which came with stuffing, and cranberry sauce and gravy and got mashed potatoes on the side.

My friends and I came for the make-your-own-gin class they have once a month. Very fun!\n\nWe got in and they immediately made each of us a drink. They make them tasty and strong which I liked. After everyone arrived they explained some of the basics to making gin and let us choose what ingredients to put in our custom gin (ingredients include herbs, spices, citrus fruit peels, and more; the gin ingredients are decided together as a group). One person we were with brought fresh rosemary from her garden, which they allowed us to use in our gin! While the gin was getting made we toured the distillery and tasted our gin at different steps of the process. It was really neat tasting how the gin's flavor changes as its being made. At the end everyone was able to label their bottle and take one home as included in the price of the class (extra bottles could be purchased for about $20). Our gin came out excellent. As a group, we were really proud of what we made! \n\nWhat I really enjoyed about this class was just how casual it felt. It felt kind you were hanging out with friends who happen to own a distillery. Chris and Matt were lots of fun to talk to. Lots of laughs that day!\n\nOverall super fun and unique place to go to (especially for the gin-making class). They told us they'd be opening a bar in downtown later this year.

I have seen pictures of the place and had to see it for myself. Upon entering the main entrance (yes they have a main entrance around the corner from the patio, but most people just enter through the patio doors instead), you are greeted w\/ a large dining area and a long bar. I really like how the light shines through the bar wall filled w\/ liquor. To the left there is a small stage for live music\/performances, and shuffleboard\/skee-ball for your drunken entertainment. As you continue on, there is a more private dining area well-suited for groups\/parties. And the patio is situated nicely, with afternoon shade and a ledge sitting area overlooking the sidewalk for people-watching.\n\nWhen a place charges $4 for PBR and $7+ for craft beer, you might as well step up to a cocktail. Quite frankly, if you are a beer drinker you have better options elsewhere on Mass Ave. But at Union 50, you are mainly there for the atmosphere and to hang out w\/ the cool kids. I tried two cocktails, one was the house special (think they just called it Union 50 Special), which was a bourbon-infused drink. The other was The Garden Herb, very earthy and refreshing. They weren't the strongest cocktails I have ever had, but good. And I liked how all the cocktails are uniformly priced ($10). Have you been to bars that charge different prices for different drinks, and when you get your bill you are like, huh?\n\nI was at Union 50 for a group event and had the opportunity to sample the food as well. The charcuterie board had a good variety of meats and cheeses. Not sure if they were local (i.e. Goose the Market) but they were fine. The fries were great. Think I had the Truffle Oil kind but there were several styles to choose from. I thought the Bacon Dates were fine but some thought they were too sweet. The Beef Trio had some tender cuts of meat, though nobody was audacious enough to try the bone morrow (if I was eating by myself I would have tried it). The Crudo Platter had several varieties of fish and side items layered on top. The fish seemed fresh enough but was more mushy than firm. If you are not a fan of raw fish there are other entrees to choose from.\n\nUnion 50 is a nice addition to Mass Ave, an upscale lounge\/restaurant that feels more spacious and open. The fact that they have a full food menu means you don't have to go somewhere else to eat. And it's one of the few places on Mass Ave that can host larger groups. The service was attentive and not pretentious (at least w\/ the servers I dealt with). Even on a weeknight the place was packed. I hope to make it back sometime soon.","date":"2014-08-11 16:04:40","vector":[0.0705333333,0.4939,0.0,0.07035,0.0]}

It's located right next to a French bakery, which we will have to try next time. Also, across from it is a Korean grocery store. (Not too far away from a very cool thrift store as well) So, after shopping at the thrift store, I decided to give this store a try!\n\nThe selection of produce was decent! Everything was neatly placed; shopping experience was mostly pleasant, but the walkways are tight. People kept bumping into me. Price-wise and quality-wise for most produce though, I'd probably stick with Lucky Supermarket and\/or Italian Centre. While I was happy to see okra at H & W, it wasn't easy selecting the edible ones; i.e. the ones that come from overly matured plants will be too tough to eat. I feel that, however, to survive at such produce stores, you really need to know how to select your produce as a consumer. There's no guides given to select quality vegetables and fruits. So, this place is for the more experienced produce shopper.\n\nI was nonetheless happy to find (Mexican) papaya from H & W; Papayas are great in aiding digestion and is high in Vitamin A. The bought fruit still has yet to ripen. Most Chinese supermarkets import papayas from Thailand -- you usually would have to pay a premium for a small slice. I probably will have to give this store a few more visits before I can really give it a 4 or 5-star rating.\n\nOh, and bring your own bags.

We went here for her 60th birthday. The decor in the restaurant is amazing. They kept a lot of the unique features of The Divine Lorraine, such as the exposed brick and the window features. The restaurant was beautifully decorated. Very cozy! My mother and I couldn't get over the chandeliers! The music was also such a great touch, really made it feel like a very cozy, upscale restaurant. Our waiter was Alex, was not only amazing, attentive and friendly and made our experience such a memorable one, but was very helpful with the menu! We absolutely loved Alex! He is a huge reason we had such an amazing time. To start my mother had a wonderful 808 Upshur St, which she loved. We ordered the Affettatto Mistro to start, which was an excellent mixture of salumi and antipasti! The meats provided (especially the prosciutto and the spread for the bread), along with the tuna stuffed peppers with capers were incredible. For entrees I ordered the Paccheri, which was an imported pasta with scorpion fish ragu mixed with tomatoes. It was amazing. I've never tried swordfish ragu, but they cooked it perfectly. My mother ordered the special of the night which was another imported pasta with a tomato based sauce and cheese. It was also so delicious! We decided to split two desserts (along with a cannoli they brought out for my mother's birthday). We chose the Baba au Rhum, which was a rum cake topped with bananas and served with a side of caramel gelato and the Bacio Pantesco, which had flavors similar to tiramisu but had layers of fried dough. Altogether we just had such a pleasant experience. Not once did we feel rushed through the meal, we were able to take our time and enjoy everything. We felt very welcome, as all of the staff were so friendly. We also were very impressed by the thoughtfulness put into the restaurant, such as the dinnerware options (all the plates were beautiful), the chairs were not only beautiful but very comfortable, the decor (we also loved the China cabinets) and even the little bio at the bottom of the menu. This restaurant just blew us away. We are very into trying new restaurants around the city and we kept saying we would absolutely come back in a heartbeat and bring the rest of our family to try. I really hope everyone has as great of an experience as we did! Really made her 60th memorable, and for that I really thank Cicala!","date":"2020-03-06 07:42:00","vector":[0.0211814815,0.4035,0.0,0.1700166667,0.8225]}

Then they used an amazing technique. It is THE BEST EVER. NOT KIDDING. IT IS SO AMAZING. IT FILLS YOUR STOMACH. \n\nOk, so prices were amazing. I bought Philly cheese steak with American cheese and no toppings, Philly steak with lettuce, and 3 drinks(don't ask). Only $33! So that's like $11 per person. (Do your math. There are 3 people.) And we used credit card!!!\n\nSo you know in regular reviews, they rate food, clean, service, etc. Everything is a 5. \n\nLast things last. GO HERE. NOW. GO IN YOUR CAR AND DRIVE. OR SOMETHING. \n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWent there again. Delicious.","date":"2019-04-25 16:46:47","vector":[-0.0150142857,0.20095,0.3701,0.0,0.0]}

The bread, if you get it unsliced, stays fresh for a couple days, and towards the end of its freshness, it's good when popped in the toaster-oven and doused with a bit of olive oil, or made into grilled cheese.  It's best right when you buy it though.\n\nThe bread is also very reasonably priced.  Metropolitan bakery, up the road, charges a good $1-2 per loaf over this place.  Its bread, in my opinion, is very good, but not quite as good...and thus, sorely overpriced.  This bakery changes the marketplace for bread, it recalibrates my sense of value.\n\nMy only suggestion for improvement is that I would really like for this place to bake and sell a few more inexpensive pastries.  The pastries are all around $2.50 or so, and while they're exquisite, they're not exactly ginormous.  $2.50 is a great price for a pastry when you're sitting down in a coffee shop, but for grab-and-go, it's pricey, and the pastry needs to have both the quality and the size to back it up.  And the pastries here are pretty.  I'd rather they make them more cheaply, and sacrifice their pretty visual appearance, but not their flavor.  I'd buy lumpy, ugly, mis-shapen pastries here for $1.50 if they were a bit bigger and tasted about the same.","date":"2011-11-03 16:49:01","vector":[-0.0009277778,0.0,0.17,0.07925,0.0]}

The menu was tight with only a handful of choices available. Generally this works to my taste buds' advantage because they are items the truck has dialed in. Natalya ordered the chicken sandwich. I went with the same and added a plate of quinoa.\n\nThe meal took a little while prepare. However it was Food Truck Friday so that was expected. The girl behind the counter constantly gave us timing updates which was nice. I never felt like I left hanging.\n\nWhen we finally got home, the food was absolutely delicious.

It's Tennessee, so we've clearly been spoiled by other states that don't allow smoking, but the smoke sucks. We know to each their own and all, but it's annoying to have to strip your clothes off as soon as you get back home or to the hotel to get the smell off of you. There is a beautiful balcony on the second level that overlooks the city; it'd be the perfect smoking area.\nAnother thing was the loudness of the music. We were at the club on a slower night, so maybe with more people it isn't as loud or maybe it's louder; we don't know. Either way, with the huge speakers they have hovering above the dance floor and on the lower level; they don't need to have the music volume as loud as it was. Our throats still hurt from having to yell to each other all night.\nThe seating was an issue too. Plenty of it, but very small tables designed for two people, three at the max. Some couches or longer tables would be ideal for the social space and more conducive for getting and allowing people to socialize with others.\nNow, to the good stuff. The club is everything you expect a southern lifestyle experience to be: beautiful layout with beautiful people. They offer complimentary valet all night so you don't have to worry about where to park.The outside looks very inviting and the club is conveniently located right downtown.\nOnce inside, there is an ATM to your right if you need cash and the check-in desk is to your left. After you check-in, you enter into the club...\nThe club has a perfectly sized social space. Once you are officially inside,there is a gift shop type store to the right where you can purchase attire,toys, condoms, lube, etc. Also located on the right is the single guys' area.This is the only area where single guys can be sexually (in the club social space they can only be at the bar unless invited to sit or dance with a couple). Couples can walk back there and single males can roam around back there between the social space and three private rooms to see if couples are back there.\nThe bar is a nice sized bar and they have all your mixers and water and of course Red Bull. We were fortunate enough to have the lovely Nicki as our bartender\/server and not only did she man the bar, she walked around from table to table asking if you needed a refill and clearing away any trash.\nOur hostess for the evening was Tiffany. She met us at the door, found a good table for us and all of our stuff, and then gave us a very detailed tour.\nAs stated before, there was plenty of seating in the social area and a good sized dance floor. On both sides of the dance floor were raised platforms for dancing with caged bars all around. There was a VIP seating area centered on the wall on the dance floor with stripper poles on both sides. The decor was literally one of the best we've seen anywhere.\nThe couple's side of the club has a lot going on from the two voyeur semi-private rooms, to the social areas with couches, to the BDSM dungeon with the cross. And that's just the first floor.\nOnce you ascend up the stairs, you enter into a library type of social space with couches for socializing or sexualizing. And to the right, there is a big open room with plenty of comfortable couches, another bar, and a public room down the hall. The greatest part about this upstairs part is the balcony that overlooks the city skyline.\nNow there is also an outside cabana area with beds and an open sky view that we didn't get to see, but sounded great.\nWe think that's it. Really a beautiful, beautiful club. Possibly cracked our top five easily. We give it 4 orgasms out of 5.","date":"2016-02-01 18:08:29","vector":[0.2202,0.0629142857,0.0,0.1515538462,0.0]}

The cashiers name was Katie (Brownie I think he last name was) and she was a sweetheart... that's where the kind words end tonight from me. After taking the persons order in front of us, she asked a much taller, older woman to 'watch the front for her'. I didn't get her name, but she was probably 5'9, 5'10. This 'woman' took one look at us, rolled her eyes and proceeded to talk at 104 decibels to someone else behind the cook line about something I couldn't quite make out. I watched as four of the workers stood behind the counter working with as much efficiency as my grandmother breathing in salt water - which suffice it to say, is 'with none'. \n\nSo fast forward five minutes... my wife and I are still standing there, still waiting for someone to even acknowledge us (ten minutes total at this point), when another woman, much shorter than a normal person, but not quite legally handicapped due to her 'shortness' came over and yelled out at the top of her lungs, \"I got four tacos, a taco supreme, blah blah blah blah blah\". The guy comes up to get the food for his family only for her to tell him that, 'yeah, we's out of chicken nuggets, chu' want sumtin else'. When he asked her 'what can he choose from'... you would have thought he said something un-nice about her four inch fingernails and how brightly they were painted. His daughter, a cute little thing, said, 'daddy, but I really wanted chicken nuggets', he told her he was sorry and just asked for strips. I looked at one of Willy Wonka's escapees with disdain and wondered, 'why would you wait until the last second, as you are handing someone their food, fifteen minutes after ordering and then tell him 'you were out' of something'. I just didn't get it. \n\nSo anyways. Katie (the nice cashier) comes back and apologizes for no one helping us... my wife ordered, I ordered and then my wife asked for some cinnamon twists. Katie informed her that 'the cooks had not made any in a few hours and that she kept telling them customers were asking for them'. We asked 'what did they say', she said, 'they didn't care'.\n\nNow mind you. I am not sure how one could surmise that the obviously overworked and underpaid (that's sarcasm) individuals in back wouldn't care about making such a staple menu item. But I can assure you, from listening to their dribble, cursing and going on and on about their lives and what they were going to do later - they did not. \n\n'Now Clider;, I can here you saying... why would you give a place with expected terrible service such a bad review. My answer to that is, 'I am a glutton for punishment'. We had not been here since the remodel so I figured, 'maybe they took out the riff raff and hired a bunch of people that actually gave a shit about their jobs and would make quality food'. This was not the case in this instance. I'll never go back to that hell hole. The food we got was luke warm. The chicken (boneless original recipe) was riddled with fat and my wifes Doritos Locos taco shell was rubbery as hell. But whatever. It's Taco Bell\/KFC, guess I should have expected that.\n\nHere is where my visit gets odd. Something strange happened while I was there, it only happened one other time when I got into a car accident, hit my head and saw my great-gam gam telling me things would be okay. The Colonel was there with me tonight, trying to place my mind at ease. As I felt the anger build up inside me about the travesty that was my visit, I felt a warm hand on my shoulder and a quiet whisper in my ear... and I knew it was Colonel Sanders. Everything kind of went black and there was a soft skinned, white bearded fella looking down on me and I just knew...\n\n...he said, \"Clider, if I could come back from the dead and burn this restaurant down, I would - and I am really sorry\". At that point, I knew that it was a lost cause... I refilled my awesome Mountain Dew Baja Blast and left. \n\nNote to the managers and franchisees of this establishment.\n\nAll levity aside. Your restaurant is terrible. To say most of the staff was discourteous at best would be a compliment. I realize they deal with a lot of rude people, but not all of us are jerks (we are actually very nice and understanding). And not that a few bucks missing a month from us will kill your bottom line, but it will start to add up... or at least, I'd like to think so. Try replacing some of the managers with people that actually know how to manage. Try hiring some more well rounded people and pay them an extra two bucks an hour and FIRE the rest. I think you'd be surprised how many people would come back knowing they wouldn't have to wait, get shitty food and have the employees look down on you with general disdai","date":"2013-05-11 01:06:59","vector":[0.0335210526,-0.04526,-0.1329,0.1145181818,0.0]}

I bring that up because Dave Potter who is the owner and wine maker for Municipal is also the owner and winemaker for Potek.    This new wine label is going to be a higher end label.  Grapes sourced for Potek are carefully selected and would more often than not be considerably more expensive than most wineries would normally use.  While I feel Dave is the master of the blend, Potek is focused more on varietals.\n\nThe winery is outside of the Funk zone and is in the new Mill building!   A very nice space and is a producing winery.   The tasting area is spacious and quite beautiful.  They have a courtyard which will be shared by the other tenants of the building as well as their own private patio.   Once the restaurant opens next door they will be doing sit-down wine and food pairings by reservation.\n\nI visited Potek during an extended soft opening.  We tasted a dry Riesling which is made in a process more commonly used for red wines.  Skins are left in after pressing and removed later.  We also had a tasty Pinot Noir as well as a Syrah.   \n\nThe winery will be open to the public on or around August 1st.","date":"2015-07-16 23:26:01","vector":[0.1106153846,0.0,0.0,0.1135333333,0.0]}

As a longtime member of the Muni wine club (and fan of winemaker Dave Potter), I can attest to the quality of Dave's wines as well as his skills as a winemaker. Dave is without a doubt one of the most versatile winemakers in SB if not the entire state of California. And Potek is truly the apotheosis of his winemaking. The Potek wines are all unique. Trust me, you've never tasted a Riesling like Potek's. The aesthetic of Potek pairs perfectly with the wine, the wine label and Dave's background. I'm a firm believer in the superficial when it comes to tasting rooms. Sorry Lompoc wine ghetto, but looks do matter. The Potek tasting room is large (a significant amount is devoted to the actual production of Potek wines).  The tasting area is a beautiful melange of dark wood layered in geometric patterns which tie in nicely with the Potek wine labels. What's really outstanding is the manner in which the wines are served. Each wine is poured in an appropriate glass. It may seem like a minor point but it truly makes a world of difference. No, I don't work for Reidel. While all of Dave's wines are enjoyable, I highly recommend his Grenache. If you're a serious wine aficionado, you'll appreciate the originality and authenticity of Potek. Cheers!","date":"2016-04-27 22:20:14","vector":[0.3036,0.0,0.0,0.1835777778,-0.0387]}

My Vietnamese mother has been going here for many years, even at it's old location. Now, nothing can beat my mom's homemade pho, not even come close. Except for King Noodle's pho. I only started going to King Noodle this year, and I am kicking myself for never going when my mom invited me, years ago. I have had pho almost everywhere in the city, and now I don't even want to continue anymore because this is the end all be all. \n\nThis pho is AMAZING. Much like a good pizza pie - starts with good crust and good sauce- pho has to start with good broth and the noodles have to be cooked just right. Moustache man's pho is amazing. The broth is fresh and tastes (like my bf has exclaimed his first time eating here) \"like STEAK!\". Any pho will always have oil tendencies, but this broth is the least oily I've had. As it tastes fresh, like steak and less oily, it's easy to go down. It doesn't make you feel gross and disgusting like many other pho places. It doesn't sit heavy in your stomach even IF you down their massive large bowl completely. The noodles are cooked perfectly and mingle well with the other components of the soup. \n\nMost pho places usually overcook their noodles (leave them sitting in the scalding broth) so that it's like baby food (read:mush) when you eat it, or undercook the noodles where they still taste al dente and disgusting (which rice noodles shouldn't be). The noodles you get in your pho at King Noodle, are just perfect. Perfect where it melts in your mouth but you can tell they're noodles and not mush. This place has the two key components that makes great pho. What is also great, is how any other part you can add in the soup from the steak flank, to your bean sprouts and mint leaves, everything is fresh. Noodle to broth ratio - equal enough that you have never have too little noodle. Amazing soup. So far, I only go here for pho, but I've heard great things about their other soups and dishes. A vietnamese friend of my bf loves their Vietnamese coffee and claims it's also the best he's ever had. \n\nThe only gripes I have (understandable gripes though): location (I live far west end and want to come here often), decor (very 70s\/80s shady-dirty like, expected of the area - Chinatown), parking is bad sometimes, chairs feel like it's going to fall apart, not enough room if you have a party of more than 4 and how it's cash only. I don't expect much service coming from a tiny pho house, and moustache man and his son (I believe) work fast and are friendly enough. Don't expect conversation, they are busy people and it's just the Vietnamese way - no offense. ASIDE from all my \"gripes\" this is my FAVOURITE place for pho. I might even want it more than I want my mom's homemade pho. In her elder years she wants King Noodle's pho more than her own! Lol. King Noodle is really the King of Pho. Believe me. Anyone who doesn't like this pho, hasn't had enough pho in their lifetime, or just doesn't know what they're talking about lol. If you plan on coming here for the first time or often, avoid the lunch & dinner rush, as it's a small place and can only fit so much. Remember, cash only!!!!\n\nI feel like I'm going to regret taking a star off, because I feel like this place is perfect. Everything is perfect about the pho I've had, haven't had any other item off of the menu (yet), and well the place could be better and accommodate more.","date":"2012-11-14 18:29:31","vector":[0.1635,0.0,0.0,0.0063714286,0.0]}

Being from Toronto, it was definitely quite the change in climate. Given this, I thought it would be good to settle down with a hearty bowl of pho. \n\nI've asked my friends and they recommended that I check out King's Noodle. As an aside, the exterior was not as sketchy as the degree to which people were warning me. Sure, there are homeless individuals but they're harmless for the most part. \n\nWalking in, I was met with a very tacky paint job that was probably done in the 70s. Despite there being only 3-4 tables seated, I was no-nonsensely pointed to a table. It's usually just a habit for me to get the Dac Biet noodle at new pho places to sample everything. \n\nI was given a large bowl of pho, usually I order extra large but this large bowl is already comparable to XL at other places. The soup was piping hot, which is definitely a plus. The broth tasted very homemade - which is a double edged sword - it was not as flavourful as it could be - but I appreciate the lack of MSG flavour . The noodles and meat are also great - wonderful portions. The side bean sprouts though looked like it was waiting a little too long to be used. Of course this isn't the best pho I've ever had since I'm from Toronto - but this was a good bowl of pho perfect for the winter. \n\nAnd yes, the moustache man's service is horrible. \n\n3.5 stars.","date":"2016-11-29 04:35:10","vector":[0.14995,-0.34,0.0,0.0963714286,0.0]}

My mom didn't like how \"MSG-y\" the broth was,  complaining that not many pho restaurants do it the real way anymore, and she felt her broth wasn't hot enough to cook all her beef.  They were a little cheap on the bean sprouts.  I mean,  c'mon, bean sprouts are cheap! My mom also didn't like how sparse the tendons were and how cheap they were to cut them into small pieces.  Mine was pretty much the same: I had two,  maybe 3, pieces of tripe, although the beef did not disappoint.  Thinly sliced and just the right amount of fattiness. The regular size is not filling at all, I find that I need the large to tide me over. The XL seems to be just more broth than noodles. \n\nDon't expect great service.  \n\nLimited free parking on the street.

The highlights were the Foie Gras donuts, which were rich and delicious, but not over powering and the moderate portion made them reasonable. The pork belly and eggs were also quite good, although simple and the flavors weren't particularly new or exciting. Sometimes you just need a hearty meat and eggs breakfast though, so this dish definitely did the trick. I especially enjoyed the Hangover burger, with its bacon, avocado, sunny side egg and thai chili mayo. It was a little difficult to eat because the bread, which was actually good, dissolved due to the streaming juices from the burger, so a different vessel may have been better suited. The mayo had a nice kick to it, but I wish there had been a bit more avocado to balance it out. \n\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience and if I find myself back in Fairmount on a weekend morning I would definitely head back to Lemon Hill.","date":"2013-02-22 17:53:17","vector":[0.1277071429,0.0,0.0,0.20772,0.5574]}

When my husband and I first moved to Tampa, we were intrigued by the strip club that also served steak. We looked at each other and decided it was a novelty we must some day try. 3 years later, on a Friday night with nothing to do, we decided to give their steak (eh-hem) a try.\n\nSurprisingly, all of the food was amazing. The bread was soft, fresh and warm. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was well marbled without the big globs of fat and very flavorful. The grilled asparagus was the ideal complement to the steak and did not need hollandaise sauce to choke it down. I would give the food 4.5 stars.\n\nThe club is very well appointed and spacious. Much larger than Mons Venus. They do serve alcohol which means that the girls don't go fully naked. I would say that the girls were rated above average to beautiful. I was extremely impressed with some of the athleticism I saw with the pole dancing and booty shaking. I've decided to steal a few of the moves for my Zumba class :D\n\nWhat I like most about this establishment is the no pressure environment. The girls were not pushy and no one approached unwarranted.

Management was attentive but not obnoxious. \n\nI would say that this establishment was better than most of the premier clubs I have been to in Vegas. ---What can I say?

Then I realized I enjoy plenty of raw foods, and ended up being delighted, entertained, and utterly fascinated by this tiny island of haute cuisine located in the West Street Market.\n\nTo start off we ordered a couple bottles of Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc ($3.00 each), a spiced, French wheat brew. It paired quite well with the creative dishes we were served by one of Reno's most talented chefs and his friendly assistant.\n\nThe menu is organized into Garden (vegan), Sea (fish), Land (mammals), and Flowers (dessert). From the Garden we went with curried, pistachio-crusted \"scallops\" (actually scallop-shaped chunks of trumpet mushroom stalk), with sprouted lentils and a cardamom chia sauce ($10.00). The texture was very similar to a cooked sea scallop, but the flavor combination was earthy, tangy, and delicious. The sprouted lentil concoction was so good my wife wanted just a bowl of that.\n\nThat is until she tried the avocado-jicama-yuzu tartare, served towering atop rapini leaves, held together with spicy chayote crisps, caramelized onions (dehydrated), and a cilantro-apple chutney on the side ($10.00). This dish was impressive both for its flavors as well as sheer engineering prowess in the construction. I'm still not sure what was holding the whole thing together, but it didn't take us long to demolish it. Of everything we tried, my wife loved this dish the best. \n\nThere are many items from the Sea on this menu, but I knew I had to try a pair of Connecticut Blue Point oysters, topped with shiso (an Asian herb of the mint family), yuzu (a small citrus fruit with a flavor somewhat like lemon-lime), and pink peppercorn mignonette sauce ($3.00 per oyster). Although I did enjoy the oysters, I guess I'm a bit of a purist. I love fresh, raw oysters, and I think the complex mix of flavors detracted more than added to this bivalve. It wasn't bad at all, but the oyster's melody was a bit lost amongst the other notes.\n\nHaving said that, the Nantucket scallop ceviche (combined with cilantro sorbet & jicama) was mind-blowingly good ($13.00). The acid of the marinade gave the scallops a texture somewhere between raw and lightly cooked, with all the flavors combining extremely well. When I return, that dish will be first on the list.\n\nBy the time we got to Land, I knew I had to try the antelope carpaccio with indigo tomato chips, pickled mushroom, and calabrese pepper, served with dehydrated fennel crisps ($13.00). My wife, who enjoys a short list of raw sushi items, was not exactly excited about trying this. Yet, she was pleasantly surprised by how much she liked it. As for me, I was stunned by the buttery texture of the meat and the perfect composition of flavors. I didn't mind a bit that my wife only ate one slice.\n\nTo finish we tried both of the available desserts. First, a plate featuring small wedges of Barinaga Ranch txiki (a semi-hard cheese made from raw sheep's milk), served with small clusters of red grapes and dehydrated onion & fennel crisps ($9.00). Next, two dainty balls of vanilla bean ice cream were served on a bed of thinly-sliced apple, topped with walnut pralines and a sprig of fresh mint ($7.00). Very refreshing.\n\nThe portions aren't very big, and I may have paid more for less food than I would normally be comfortable with. Yet, I feel like I came out way ahead in this equation. The experience & deliciousness was worth every penny, and the atmosphere was sophisticated yet casual. Want to impress a date? Take her to Rawr and she'll never forget you, although she might fall in love with the chef. It's a risk worth taking.","date":"2014-02-28 22:25:03","vector":[0.098180597,0.0,0.2263,0.1254777778,0.0]}

Instead they would make one item from our order then put us at the end of the queue and make something for everyone else that showed up after us.

I was all like \"that used to house a Cleats soccer store back in the day\" but who buys soccer shoes at stores these days? They're located between the World Health gym and Gini's. I  looked Bliss up online and was pleasantly surprised to find out that their bakery specialize in Jewish goodies. 100% kosher, dairy free and nut free!\n\nBliss's product list is long and includes breads, pastries, fresh foods, custom cakes and catering. I took a look at their fresh food offerings but nothing stood out to me. There was a stir fry and chili in take out containers if you want a quick bite to eat (no place to sit inside though).\n\nThat wasn't what I was there for - I've been trying to make it on a Friday so that I could grab a loaf of challah bread (which apparently they also do on Thursdays) but their Friday hours are the worst - only open till 2pm. Who the heck can get there by then!?! Apparently loads because they were already out of their famous donuts by the time I dropped by at 12:30pm. The lady\/co-owner told me that they ran out by 10am. Yowzers. Get there early if you want your donut fill. I say \"famous\" because Avenue Magazine voted their cinnamon and sugar donuts as best in 2013.\n\n- Challah bread ($6.50) - the only time I ever have challah bread is when my one friend invites me over to Chabbat dinner and I am lucky enough to eat his mom's challah bread straight from the oven. How did Bliss's compare? Pretty darn good. Super fresh, fluffy, airy delicious egg bread goodness. This was gone over the weekend. Happy I know a spot that does it justice!\n\n- Persian breads ($6.50) - there was a couple different toppings to choose from (garlic, onion, all-dressed, zatar or hot peppers with onions). These looked pretty interesting and are also only available on Fridays so I decided to give their zatar version a try. A little more zatar flavouring would have been ideal but this was suprisingly good. Slightly pricey but the bread has a nice chew to it.\n\n- Montreal-style bagel ($2.50) - got these for 1\/2 price because they were from the freezer. Except the lady forgot to give me my change back so it worked out to be pretty much regular price ($5.00). Oh well. I haven't been able to find anything even close to St. Viateur's bagels since I moved back but I'm always on the lookout for Montreal style bagels. These fit the bill, at least by their description. Sadly, that's where comparisons end. I don't even know if you can call this a bagel? It's more like a bun to make a sandwich\/burger. Sigh, luckily, I still have a bunch of St. Viateur bagels frozen to satisfy my cravings.\n\n- Apple strudel ($4.00) - real apple strudel, according to the lady helping me out. I liked how there were raisins on the inside to give it some sweetness but I wasn't blown away.\n- Blueberry turnover ($3.00) - pickings were slim in the pastry options but there were fruit turnovers that caught my eye. Peach and blueberry to chose from, I went with the latter. Again, decent but nothing worth raving about.\n\nGlad I finally was able to try out their challah bread. Definitely grab one if you're there Thursday or Friday! I'll be back to try some donuts. Make sure you bring cash or debit as they don't take credit cards.","date":"2016-03-21 15:05:25","vector":[0.1381609756,0.0,0.07636,0.0680625,0.0]}

Well, let me tell you, when I got home and bit into one, I was transported back to my childhood (which is why I was craving that treat in the first place - I was feeling nostalgic). I want to go back soon to try some award-winning doughnuts and maybe some bread. I was served by Mr. Bliss' wife, and she was extremely friendly and helpful.

The bakery is owned by husband-and-wife team Lawrence and Shaindel Bliss, who have been running Bliss Baked Goods since they started the business on 118th Avenue more than 11 years ago. They moved into the new Glenora location in September 2014.\n\nThe bakery specializes in 100% kosher, dairy-free and nut-free baked goods, with a number of vegan options, including pastries and some specially made doughnuts.\n\nWe visited on a Friday morning to pick up a dozen doughnuts for the office and ended up chatting with Lawrence and Shaindel, who explained their bakery's philosophy and specialities. They gave us a taste of the cinnamon and sugar doughnut, which immediately brought me back to my favourite bakery in England--the soft, fluffy texture of the doughnut mixed with the gritty sweetness of the perfect blend of cinnamon and sugar. I haven't had a doughnut like that in years.\n\nThey insisted I take with me a vegan maple doughnut, which I devoured as soon as I returned to the office. I've never had a vegan doughnut before and, to my surprise, it wasn't much different from a regular doughnut. It was delicious, creamy, soft--everything you'd assume a vegan doughnut could never be. (Then again, if they can make vegan bacon...)\n\nAfter tasting the delicious treats at Bliss Baked Goods, I'm not surprised to learn that they were recognized in Avenue Magazine's 25 Best Things to Eat (2013) for their cinnamon and sugar doughnuts. I strongly recommend giving these treats a try the next time you're in the neighbourhood (and even if you're not).","date":"2015-02-06 23:41:55","vector":[0.21753,0.0,0.0,0.0817,0.0]}

We also picked up a nicely executed apple strudel- nice flakey layers with a thick layer of cooked cinnamony apples in the centre. Picked up a small loaf of challah bread as our toddler loves the soft sweet braided bread.  Last but not least, we picked up what we originally came in for... a chocolate overload cake! The cake layers had the texture of a rich lucious chocolate brownie, and the light tasting dairy free creme in the centre helped offset the super sugary chocolate ganache the whole cake was enrobed in. Delish, though next time I'll ask for no ganache or a semi\/bittersweet chocolate ganache.. so I'm not sugar overloaded when I want a big slice instead of a little slice of this chocolate overload cake.

My boyfriend got the BBQ shrimp but they forgot the french bread so it was just a bowl of shrimp.  The steak was pretty fatty but it had a good flavor, same with the chard that was drowning in butter.  All of the food was pretty good, my cocktail was tasty, and I live in the area so I'm glad I tried it out.  Roux Public House looks like it was an old fashioned New Orleans house converted into a restaurant, and we ate on the balcony so it had a good atmosphere.

Service was excellent - attentive & they even provided our toddler with a coloring page from a Dora coloring book and a few crayons.\n\nWe opted to try a little of everything from their seafood options. \n\nUnfortunately the food did not live up to our hopes - my husband and I both agreed we would give the food 2 stars based on quality and price; however the attentive and quick service have elevated Back Home to 3 stars.\n\nTo start, we shared a bowl of their Seafood Chowder with garlic toast- $6.95 \n\nThe seafood chowder was hearty - though I think a slightly larger bowl would be reasonable for the price.  Lots of chopped up white fish and bits of shrimp.  Not your typical heavy cream for a clam chowder - tasty none the less!  Uploaded a pic!\n\nSeafood Delight Plate - $22.95 : 1 piece Haddock, 6 Digby Scallops, 5 Black Tiger Shrimp, 3 Rings of Calamari, 4 oz. of Clam Strips & French Fries.  Everything on this platter was deepfried :-(  Both the Scallops and Calamari were overcooked in the deep fryer - I wonder if everything was just thrown in one basket and fried the same amount of time?  I've uploaded a pic!\n\n3 piece Haddock & Chips $12.50 - Hubby enjoyed the lightness of the batter.\n\nThe table had salt and pepper, seafood sauce, and white vinegar (no malt vinegar) set upon it.\n\n\nIn summary - a nearly $50 meal with tip seems a little hefty for the food we ate.  My husband really enjoyed the batter on their fish and didn't find it greasy at all.  I was disappointed that everything on the Seafood Platter was deepfried - including the scallops when purcahsed separately on the menu as an entree you get to choose how they are cooked.\n\nService was pleasant and efficient!\n\nI'd stick to the basics here - and avoid the more expensive platters.","date":"2011-07-03 17:41:06","vector":[0.0241375,0.3608333333,0.0,0.0851,0.0]}

I've had a hankering for a decent fish and chips for a while now (our last 'chippy tea' was at Brit's on Argyle and it was terrible), so I was ecstatic when we moved to the 124 St area and we came across Back Home. It looked like a typical greasy spoon, the prices were reasonable and it was in walking distance. We thought we may as well give it a try. \n\nWhen we got in, we took our seats, were offered drinks etc just as in any other restaurant. The clientele was a lot older than us but we thought nothing of it. The atmosphere was a little cold, the servers looked sad, and there was no music (if there was it was inaudible). But I really didn't care I just wanted fish and chips. The four of us ordered our fish and chips and the server suggested we get the platter to save a little money. The server said our food would be ready in a few minutes but we were waiting for a very long time. \n\nOur platter arrived, 10 pieces of fish, a 'large' portion of chips, and a 'large' pot of gravy. Had the chips and gravy been for two people it would have been enough but they were definitely not for 4 people. Plenty of fish for us though. I also ordered mushy peas, which should have been called 'wet and hard' peas. I don't know if its a Brits vs Newfoundland folk thing, but mushy peas should not be so hard. We were only offered one drink while we were eating (when my boyfriend asked for another, our server didn't ask anyone else if they needed drinks), and once we had finished, we asked our server if we could take the fish home and it never came back out. Nor were we offered dessert, just given our bill. We had wanted pie but decided we would get dessert elsewhere. The price was great, $60 for the 4 of us with drinks, the platter and extras, but there was a kerfuffle at the till when we asked to pay separately. \n\nOverall, the fish and the chips were good, the gravy was adequate but the peas were awful. The service, decor and atmosphere were not great so we won't be dining in again. In future, we will be getting fish and chips for take out and making our own peas and gravy.","date":"2015-08-30 16:42:29","vector":[0.0185586207,0.0,0.24695,-0.10192,0.0]}

If you are looking for some heart wrenching, deep fried fish and chips, then this could be your place to go. \n\nI have visited Back Home Fish & Chips a few times now for family gatherings, not because the food is superb, but more for the nostalgia. The restaurant itself is very plain Jane, no frills with simple diner tables and laminated place mats. They do not have free underground parking anymore, as it is paid. But, you will see that crossed off the menu with a black sharpie.\n\nThey have other items on the menu besides fish and chips, but I have never tried them. I am always skeptical of trying something that is not their signature dish per say. I have tried the calamari which was large deep fried rings that were not too chewy. \n\nFish and chips wise, the staple is cod. But you can also upgrade to another fish, if you like. We usually get the family style fish and chips with a side of coleslaw (included) and gravy (not vegetarian). Honestly, I cannot eat that much fish and chips as the grease can be a bit overwhelming.

And love that they use compostable\/recyclable packaging and utensils. Will definitely be coming back!!!","date":"2021-03-07 00:10:10","vector":[0.2265333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Having lived in the Bay Area for a number of years, which is absolutely saturated with new fro-yo shops seemingly popping up every week, my standards are high...probably too high.\n\nFor those of you unaware, Pinkberry started in LA about 5 years ago, and quickly spread across all of California in a craze of popularity, for good reason. They make all their yogurt fresh on-site with fresh ingredients. They make each yogurt with a base fro-yo, which is ... wait for it ... NATURALLY TART ... like actual yogurt is naturally tart ...because it's actually REAL yogurt (unlike 90% of fro-yo places). Then, they add REAL ingredients to flavor it, like REAL peanut butter, or mango puree, etc... Finally, if you want toppings, they have an assortment of FRESH fruit and gourmet indulgences such as mango, raspberry, caramel, dark chocolate, and MOCHI!\n\nIf you want quantity, go to your run-of-the-mill self-serve garbage fro-yo shops...there's plenty around town. But if you want QUALITY yogurt, look no further - this is the place!\n\nOnly crappy point is that this place is located at the UofA on-campus inside of the student union, so getting here (with parking, etc) is a PITA... but it's worth the hassle! \n\nBy the way, this is the ONLY Pinkberry located in Arizona, and the FIRST one located on a college campus...way to go UofA!\n\nA tip: when adding toppings, you can get as much as you want. Don't think they added enough? Tell them to add more. Want chocolate drizzle on it? Ask for it. Want a big waffle wafer stuck on top? Just ask.

My grandparents are on a first name basis with almost everyone at the restaurant. Don't expect anything fancy when coming here but you will get tasty food and lots of it. They always bring out fresh bread (I believe its from a nearby bakery) with olive oil and fresh cracked pepper followed by a pasta salad to start and then their entrees all come with soup or salad. The salad with their house garlic feta dressing is delicious... they need to sell it by the bottle. Most of the entrees come with a pasta of your choice which is a nice way to change things up if you're like me and you learn towards ordering the same dish every time you're there. One of my favorites when they have it is the stuffed salmon. I usually end up taking about 2\/3rds of it home though because the portion is so large. They also always have wonderful homemade desserts. Even if I'm too full for one there my grandpa always has me get one to go :) They bring around a tray of them for you to look out so its almost impossible to say no to at least one. They do get pretty busy on the weekends so reservations aren't a bad idea but you can also sit in the bar if you want. After all the years of going here I've never left unsatisfied so they're doing something right.","date":"2013-10-28 18:45:33","vector":[0.159825,0.0,0.0,0.0386,0.0]}

I completely respect entrepreneurs who take a risk in starting up their own business but if you do not know how to run an efficient business, you should consider another alternative.  \n\nI chose Terese, the owner of A Piece of Cake, to make the cake for our July 2011 wedding.  When I first reached out to her in March 2011 she responded quickly and was very pleasant.  My husband and I met with her in May 2011 for our cake testing and were pleasantly surprised with her cakes.  We signed a contract and handed her a check for the full amount at that time.  I reached back out to Terese in June to touch base because she had communicated she would send me pictures of cake pedestals we could use.  Our negative experience with Terese began from that point on.  \n\nI contacted her via email and left voicemails for her numerous times and she never responded.  Finally after about 3 weeks of this, my husband became involved and left her a message indicating we wanted our money back unless she responded.  Surprisingly enough she called soon after that voicemail was left and claimed to have sent me an email...I never received an email.  We both had a very bad feeling about the cake situation but we were already in June and our wedding was in July.  At least a month before the wedding I contacted her to ensure she was going to provide a cake box for our cake.  Our cake was simply going to be a two tier token cake used for the cutting of the cake pictures and our intention was to serve it at our brunch the next day.  We had another dessert option for the reception.  She was aware of this and assured us weeks later after sending my email that yes, a cake box would be provided.  I again asked her a few days before the wedding about the cake box and she once again assured me she would provide a cake box.  \n\nUltimately she did not deliver the cake box.  She later told us she simply forgot to take it out of her car and bring into the reception venue.  Without a proper cake box our caterer opted to put our cake in a Fed Ex box that had contained items shipped for our wedding.  Our caterer failed to tell anyone they had placed the cake in this type of box and the cake was destroyed once placed in the car because no one knew the cake was stored in the Fed Ex box.  Honestly, based on the fact she was so unresponsive I was fully prepared to not have a cake delivered.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was there which is pretty sad.  We contacted Terese after our wedding to discuss what had happened and request some type of refund considering her failure to deliver the cake box resulted in us only taking two bites of our cake.  After some discussion she agreed to give us half of the cost of the cake back but we never heard from her again and never received the check.\n\nTerese may be a good baker and cake decorator but she is not a good business woman.  It is unfortunate she has not learned this over the years after reading some of these reviews.  Please spare yourself any anxiety or worry about your wedding cake and opt for a more established bakery.  If I could do it all over again, I would have paid a little bit more and gone for a brick and mortar bakery that has real business experience.","date":"2012-01-06 03:45:40","vector":[-0.0367,0.003,-0.12765,-0.0422857143,0.0]}

That should have been my first clue but still the cake was so good. I gave her a deposit for the wedding cake and after she left notice there was a discrepancy so called to get a new copy. After three months of leaving messages with her mom, son and voice mail, plus emails, Even once where her son answered the phone, said yes she is here, hold on. I heard him tell her it was me and she said no, tell her i'm not here. Finally she called me back after three months. She did take some money off the cake for the inconvenience. Out of all my vendors she was the only person I was concerned about. The cake arrived and tasted great! The only things is she made fondant leaves and they were ugly and were suppose to be gold and it was barely that. I gave her a pic of the exact cake so there wasn't any confusion. Now our one year anniversary is here and were are suppose to get a cake....we will see how that goes :)  My advice is if you love cake and don't mind the unknown...go for it.

Which happened to be Bar Louie (it was in the building we were staying in). The Gulch is an AWESOME neighborhood - so I'm somewhat kicking myself for not going to a less chain service restaurant.\n\nWe got sat almost immediately upon entering, however, it took a good 20 minutes before we were ever acknowledged by server - and this only happened after we waved down a bus boy to ask for our server.\n\nOnce she finally comes out (I think her name was Halley) she explains to us she had people taking their servers test and she had to over see. My first thought was - who makes people take their servers test on a Friday night at 8:30? Do they expect to have that slow of service? second though - after working as a server I would never blame my lateness on other people I would do everything I could to earn back my tables trust. Free appetizer? maybe a round of drinks - make it work. But sadly, she did not. And it only got worse from there.\n\nI ordered a blood orange mule -and it honestly was one of the worst cocktails I've ever tasted. So after one drink I asked her if I could send it back and possibly just have a regular a Moscow mule? Well - at Bar Louie this concept does not exist. She told me \"once the drink hits the table it cannot be taken back\". WHAT kind of a policy is that??? One that should be reevaluated. That's for sure. \n\nThe food was okay. The buffalo chicken flatbread was decent - I would give more stars for that if the service wasn't so awful. The calamari was bland. The nachos only had like 3 pieces of chicken. \n\nOverall - horrid experience at Bar Louie.","date":"2015-03-05 01:22:31","vector":[0.07057,0.0,0.0,0.3035,0.0]}

I specifically said I was a vegetarian, and I don't eat any seafood, yet the staff seemed to think that with that description, any of the sauces would be okay for me. That's not true, as I found out from the downtown Oodle Noodle location, because all but two of the sauces are made with oyster sauce. So be wary.\n\nI loved Oodle Noodle Lemongrass, but it turns out it has oyster sauce, so I won't be ordering it again.\n\nThe two vegetarian options (they refer to them as the \"vegan\" options) that contain no seafood are the Tokyo Glaze and Kung Pao. My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed the Kung Pao, but I think next time I'll try it with vermicelli noodles. Would love to see more veggie options here. There's certainly no good reason why they can't use mock (vegetarian) oyster sauce! Overall, Oodle Noodle is always tasty, and they make Wok Box look like a supreme joke. Anything off the Oodle Noodle menu is brimming with flavor, and I love that you can order with any choice of tofu (or meat) with any dish. You can also substitute any noodle of your choice for any noodle they usually use with any dish.\n\nIt's definitely one of my go-to places when I want a stir-fry, but I won't be going too frequently, as I would wear out the only two options I have when I go! They're a great bang for the buck, as the to-go boxes they put all of the food in are absolutely packed.

Part of it is the obvious fact that they use Roast Inc. coffee: a big plus; but the greater part of is that they seem to be so joyful in what they do that it really is a lot of fun just to be there.\n\nAnother deal that jumps out as a plus is their signature drink.  Why don't more places have a signature drink?  It really stands out and makes it a place to visit.  And this signature drink is a real doozy: a cayenne mocha.  Imagine the beloved mocha with a serious spicy kick.  The coffee, the frothy milk, the smooth chocolate, and then the spice punching you right in the back of the throat.\n\nThis place is muy small, but that just makes it cozy.

Friendly service.

Not the typical American cheeseburger and downright enjoyable for its unique flourishes. But then on the way out, I saw the chef cooking up the sausage sandwich and I literally fantasized about that thing until my next visit. \n\nI think I overlooked it because on the menu it just says \"sausage sandwich.\" And in the land of hot sausage poboys on every corner, that simple text didn't draw me in.

Just wow. \n\n I've had the other items, the pork sliders, the chicken, the ropa vieja, all good, all excellent value and generous portions.

She was convinced that she'd seen my boyfriend (not me) there before, which could have turned hairy, but I just assume that my domestic partner is smart enough to not take his girlfriend and his mistress to the same restaurant. Cathy asked him if we were married, which was also all kinds of priceless awkward. I don't know what she was saying while she adoringly pinched my boyfriend's goatee, but holy wow, she pinched my boyfriend's goatee! Even I don't get to do that.\n\nWe weren't planning to drink, but the underpriced cocktails were only a dollar more than the overpriced sodas, which is as good a reason as any in my book. The boyfriend had a Manhattan and I had my first ever Pink Squirrel. They were both on the small side, but worth the money. The complimentary tea was too smoky for my liking.\n\nSomehow we managed to order most of what we wanted. We started with scallion pancakes, which were a bit tough but not too shabby. The mango chicken was delicious, although I remembered the mango beef more fondly. One item that was totally new to us was the strawberry chicken which, if you can believe it, smelled and tasted like a strawberry-flavored hookah. This proved to be too disconcerting for the boyfriend, and I'm not sure I'd order it again myself, but it was interesting to eat something I'd only ever inhaled. Cathy objected to our ordering mu shu pork on the grounds that it wouldn't go with the rest of our meal, so we went with her suggestion of pork and bok choy in garlic sauce and were duly impressed.\n\nI really look forward to coming here for a second sampling of mango beef, but I'll probably leave the rest of the planning up to Cathy.","date":"2010-11-24 02:28:59","vector":[0.157825,0.2899,0.0,0.16455,0.0]}

Papa B. is a very involved Coral Casino member, and he comes to Tydes and the casual restaurant below pretty often.  Tydes is the more upscale option, a fancy restaurant that takes its name from the ubiquitous-in-Santa-Barbara Ty Warner, of Beanie Baby fame.  Ty enjoys inserting his name into the titles of his various business ventures.  Lazy and conspicuous, but pretty entertaining.\n\nThe restaurant is sunny and relaxing at lunch, with a lot of natural light and a lovely ocean view.  The decor is beachy and painted a dull salmon color that must be designed to appeal to retired folk.  Black and white photographs on the walls show Michael Douglas and Sigourney Weaver and various other celebrities who have visited the Casino over the years.\n\nThe dining room was calm at 1:00 on a Saturday.  We got a nice comfortable corner table with a great view.  Service was good, attentive and moderately fast.\n\nThe menus at Coral Casino reflect member and guest prices that are very far apart.  Tydes is the main high-end dining option for guests at the Four Seasons across the beach, and apparently members of the Casino are not eager to turn their space into a hotel annex.  I laughed when I saw the $15 Nathan's hot dog (still a hefty $8 for members).\n\nThe menu was straightforward, with simple everyday fare done very well.  We started with a basket of white bread with salt and butter, a cut above the usual bread service.  I had a delicious chicken burger when I dined downstairs, and this time I opted for the Baja fish tacos.  These were big beautiful tacos filled with grilled local mahi mahi and pickled cabbage, with lime, cilantro creme, salsa, and guacamole on the side.  The fish was flaky and moist with a satisfying meaty flavor, and the cabbage and accompanying toppings were great.  The tortillas were pliant and sturdy enough to hold the insides.  The tacos came with a choice of side, and I opted for the onion rings.  These were decent, more thickly battered than ideal, but with a good crisp.  I also tried Matt's burger and fries.  It was a basic cheeseburger with bacon, but notably tasty, with a great patty.  Fries weren't as good, but they weren't bad either.\n\nThe final bill wasn't terrible with the member prices, and the meal was pleasant with a peaceful atmosphere and solid food.  I wouldn't come without a member, but Tydes is a good restaurant for a meal by the sea.","date":"2012-06-28 20:46:25","vector":[0.1474066667,0.08808,0.0,0.2102,0.0]}

The entire staff from hostess to servers congratulated us on our Anniversary.\n\nThe husband had the Seabass with risotto And I had the filet with spinach and frites...the herb fries were amazing! And my filet and spinach were perfectly seasoned. My husband considered his Sea bass to be the best he's ever had! They also had his favorite Grgich Hills Chardonnay by the glass so that was an added bonus! I tried their signature cocktail the Tanatini!? And it was pretty good too! We also had their Brussel sprouts which were super Delish!\n\nSo now I read some of the complaints about the prices but they seemed pretty reasonable compared to LA or Orange County standards. I don't understand what that was all about....\n\nTo top it off we decided to pass on the dessert so we could go hang out at the hotel bar and they were still so kind and gave us an adorable plate with \"Happy Anniversary\" and some berries, nuts, and chocolate shavings! \n\nWe really liked our dinner experience here...if we came during the day I think the ocean view would have been breathtaking. \nIt was a truly memorable experience!","date":"2013-12-13 04:51:33","vector":[0.1009222222,0.1906333333,-0.2144,0.17938,0.0]}

The food, and the price of that food.  The scallops:  you get 3 scallops sitting on top of a very hot rock, from which it is nigh on impossible to remove them without leaving much of the meat behind. $38.  The bouillabaisse was breathtakingly disappointing.  Close to $40 for one small piece of fish, one scallop and three tiny (shell-less) mussels hiding at the bottom.  Yes, really, that was it!  Not a prawn, nor a piece of calamari, or a clam in sight.  What is more,  there  were four small pieces of bread, that had once been toast,  that were covered in broth and completely  soaked.  At first I thought  they were pieces of fish, but they were just bread, put there to bulk it up and make it look like you were getting more.  So, about $80 for two dishes that contained a total of four scallops, one small  chunk of fish and three tiny mussels.  I have eaten in some very fine restaurants all over the world and I have to say this was the most  utterly disappointing and ridiculously expensive  Bouillabaisse I have ever had.  You would be better off ordering the steak frites, but if you do, be prepared to spend $45 for it.   Overall, a complete rip-off.  When I pay $40 for a plate of food it had better be pretty damn special.

It was the second time I'd been and I was impressed both times.\n\nThe place is a typical small Italian restaurant... 10-15 tables, most of them booths, dim lighting, linen and candles on the tables.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, and made excellent recommendations.\n\nMy mother and I shared a bottle of wine and my brother and dad each had a beer.  (Nice to find a little hole-in-the-wall with four or five things on draft.)  We had a calamari appetizer recommended by the waiter--it had peppers, olives, and tomatoes sauteed with the calamari and was delicious.  They brought out some sort of tasty ciabatta-ish bread before the meal--I was impressed by how much they gave us.\n\nI got portobello ravioli, my mother had chicken Cacciatori, my dad had some sort of seafood marinara (he was pissed that they were out of steak, until the marinara showed up), and my brother got the chicken alfredo.  None of us were disappointed by our meals--mine and my dad's were particularly delicious.  My only complaint is that the portions, although reasonable, were smaller than what you'd expect at most Italian restaurants.  Only my mother had leftovers.\n\nThe manager didn't come over to bug us while we were eating, which was nice, but when we got up to leave he jumped up and held the door for us and wished me a happy birthday.\n\nOverall, I was very impressed by everything I had at Fiorito's, but thought that it was a little overpriced for what we got.  Maybe it would be better for someone who doesn't have alcohol with dinner.","date":"2009-07-13 21:00:03","vector":[0.0373263158,0.1646333333,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The one star goes to the waiter and bartender who both did their jobs well.  Aside from pleasant and attentive service, the experience was pretty much disgusting.  We parked behind the building and walked past the open kitchen door which revealed sights and smells that discouraged my food service savvy self, but grumbling tummies pushed us through the front door.  We ordered Ceasar Salad for two and a pizza topped with sundried tomatoes, spinach and prosciutto.  My salad order was an attempt to gauge the quality of the kitchen, and I was sadly not surprised.  I took a bite, and tasted... fish...? We were served a room temperature plate of rotting vegetables drowned in dressing, topped off with a few blackened croutons.  The pizza was also thoughtlessly prepared...undercooked and mushy in the middle, unable to support the weight of the two pounds of cheese, and the \"prosciutto\" tasted a lot like deli sliced smoked ham. I told the waiter the salad was inedible and foul, but did not complain about the pizza, finding satisfaction in another glass of wine and pizza crust dipped in oil. We were comped 25% from the total check, but will never ever go back.  The entrees may be better, but I don't care to find out.  I'd love to inspect the walk-in fridge... bet there's no prosciutto in the house.","date":"2010-04-22 19:03:27","vector":[-0.0267647059,0.0,0.0,0.0617375,0.0]}

This is my first time giving a 1-star rating and I debated on whether it would be helpful. In the end, I feel I must warn other diners.\n\nTo start, the food is excellent. But the service and experience was awful. When my boyfriend and I walked in on a Wednesday night, the restaurant was empty except for one large party (probably about 8 to 10 people). Our waitress was pleasant enough, though not particularly attentive or helpful. When I asked for some guidance on what to order, she basically said everything was good and took a while to try to point out 3 to 4 specialties or popular menu items. It's just really irritating when waiters\/waitresses tell me everything on the menu is good. I would hope so, or why else would the restaurant be serving it?\n\nThe worst offense was that our food took 50 minutes to arrive. Yes, 50 minutes, despite being an almost empty restaurant! After inquiring with our waitress several times on the status of our order, she came by our with another staffer and they apologetically explained their kitchen was backed up because they had a ton of GrubHub orders to fill. I realize they were attempting to explain the situation, but the fact that they did not realize how insulting it is for a dine-in patron to be told that takeout\/delivery orders take priority is beyond me. I relayed that sentiment, which was met with more apologies.\n\nIn the end, all we got were more apologies (which I should add were only offered because I showed my displeasure for the wait time!) and nothing else to improve my experience.

The website however says Georgetown is closest to me and won't let me do an online order for delivery from the West Washington location.  \n\nOn Google maps, West Washington is exactly 3 miles from my house and Georgetown is 3.3.\n\nI spoke to a female manager about this in June 2016 and put an edit about it in my last review.  She had told me that her store on West Washington was indeed in my area.  She was going to speak to her corporate manager that was coming in that day about the discrepancies with the website.  She told me to go ahead and place an order online for carryout for her store & then call and that they would do delivery here.  She was putting a note by the cash register about it, she said.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, New Year's Day, my dad called in an order to the West Washington location.  He didn't have access to internet and was using the phone book.  He was all ready to have pizza and then they called and said they cancelled the order because they don't deliver here.  Click.

I placed an order for delivery over the phone last night (just a few hours ago.)  \n\nI wish I had made a better mental note of names, which I don't recall, but the guy who answered the phone was wonderful & professional.  The delivery driver was fast and a real sweetheart.  Both awesome guys I would gladly deal with again.\n\nIf you know me, this is a food definitely out of the norm for myself, but I have been contemplating rethinking my diet.  While this isn't exactly healthy fare, it has been YEARS, sounded good, and was a matter of convenience.  That being said, it might not be knock-your-socks-off pizza, but very good.  It looked absolutely perfect, as you can see in my pic.  No cheese running off to one side or other horrors that sometimes accompany delivery.  It tasted pretty good, too, though I am not accustomed to cheese anymore so it doesn't taste WOW to me like it once did.\n\nI ordered a large with onion and black olives.  I also wanted tomato, but they ran out.  No biggie.  I love mushrooms, but left them off out of consideration for my dad.  Opening the box, I was reminded of all the Papa John's I used to get once upon a time with my late sister.  The signature pepperoncini peppers inside and the cup of garlic dipping sauce.  YUM!  Ah the memories.  Eight generously sized slices in this pie.  Thick, soft crust that is great dipped in the sauce.  Nearly no grease on this thing.\n\nThe driver called me as his GPS had sent him the wrong end of my road.  He was extremely apologetic for the delay, but I honestly felt it was unbelievably fast even with the technological hiccup.  From the time I ordered to the time I received my pie was just a little over half an hour and definitely within the time frame I was given.  No complaints here.\n\nMy large, two-topping (15\") pizza was $19.77 after tax and delivery charge, not including tip.  I may have been able to get a better deal if I had ordered online, but I wanted to pay cash and wasn't sure how that would work.  Homework for later.  It is about the going rate for pizza from what I am told.  \n\nOpen later than many other pizza joints in the area from what I know, a huge convenience for a night owl and agoraphobe.  That along with quality, speed and SUPERB service has me thinking five stars all the way!  This will not become a regular staple for me, but I know who to call next time I have a hankering for pizza in Speedway.\n\nEDIT:  Additionally, I recently phoned the manager one afternoon. (June 2016)  The Papa John's website is incorrect in saying that the Georgetown store is closest to me. I have checked Google maps and know I have called for delivery from West Washington. She agreed that her store handles my area and was going to bring it up to her corporate manager that was coming in that day. Despite that and my email previously to Papa John's website, the delivery map is still incorrect. However, this manager was great and said I was welcome to order online as a carry-out and call them directly to change it to delivery. Very accommodating and I appreciate that!","date":"2016-03-10 07:09:05","vector":[0.0863157895,0.0,-0.05135,0.00325,0.0]}

We had the Rustica, which was delicious homemade penne, sausage and sweet peppers.  It had the perfect amount of sauce, (not drowning the dish) and a generous amount of sausage.  The portions were plenty for us, and it's not Maggiano's where you can take home dinner for the Brady bunch, including Alice, Sam and even Oliver.  My wife had the Vongole, which was good, not great.  The wine sauce could have been cooked down a bit, but the clams were good and in both cases, the pasta was cooked perfectly.  I think our dishes were $15 each and there was more than enough food for a meal. If I could just say, the Glenlevit pours were about as generous as you could ever hope for.  I had 2, so I don't remember how much they cost, but  I do recall thinking the first was a kill the bottle pour, but the 2nd was filled to the rim (in a big glass) as well.

The total still came to $25 and change! That's for two burgers, two sodas, and one order of fries! Ok,.. fine, from what I remembered, the burgers are huge and maybe worth this rare expense. Well, things have changed. The patty looked like it came out of a press as it had squared-off edges, rather than having that hand-made, plump and juicy look, with rounded-off edges, that they used to have. It was cooked more than medium (as ordered) and there was just barely enough guacamole to cover the patty after I spread it out.

Aside from that it was a fun little place to spend time at and grab a cup of coffee to get your caffeine fix.","date":"2021-05-28 18:45:04","vector":[0.0489333333,0.0,0.7579,0.14446875,0.0]}

We wanted a sit-down restaurant with fast service since we had somewhere else we had to be and Sonny's was the first place that came to mind.\n\nThe cleanliness of the restaurant is so-so. Not enough to have you make an immediate u-turn out the moment you step inside, but it just doesn't seem to be a top priority. For example, there was water spilled all along the tiled part of the floor that no one had addressed before or after we left. The table at the front of the restaurant that had toothpicks and brochures was also dirty and covered in dust. Things like that. Our actual table we were seated at was fine though. \n\nThe service was good. Our waitress made sure to check in and see how we were doing, but was never overbearing. The food always comes out quickly, which is what we wanted! Although on a side note, the table that was right across from us... the people came in before we did and apparently there was an issue with their order because they didn't get their food until we were just finishing our meal. The manager even came by to apologize - hopefully they got something taken off their meal because they were waiting a long time. But that seems to be the exception rather than the rule because Sonny's is QUICK to get your food out to you.\n\nI got the lunch portion of the House Dry-Rubbed ribs - the same thing I get every time! It has been awhile since I've been to Sonny's and I could have sworn this came with four ribs before, but now it is three. You also get your choice of two sidekicks - I got the fries and mac and cheese this time. Then you get your choice of cornbread or garlic bread - I got the garlic bread.\n\nThe ribs were pretty good - not the best I've ever tasted, but they aren't bad either. You can eat them as they are, or they include three types of sauce at your table - mild, sweet, and smokin'. Since I had three ribs, I put a different sauce on each rib. Definitely my favorite is the smokin'... and I put that on my garlic bread as well!\n\nFries are crinkle-cut and a little... dry? But once you dip them in ketchup, they taste better. The mac and cheese was just okay. I only had a bite or two of it. I wish I had gotten the corn on the cob or baked beans instead, which I know are delicious!\n\nThis Sonny's BBQ has a drive-thru option if you want to get something to go. Never done it before, but might try it one day to take something back to work for lunch since it is just a few miles away. \n\nIf you want a quick BBQ fix and are short on time, try Sonny's! But there are definitely better options out there if you want BBQ or ribs.","date":"2015-10-18 14:44:43","vector":[0.0315807692,0.0,0.0,0.0988555556,0.0]}

I was given the responsibility of picking a good restaurant for my friend's 1-day welcome back party (which was also a sorority meet-up which was also a friends sisters birthday celebration.) Using Yelp, we picked Giordano's due to the relative proximity of a karaoke place nearby and were hanging to sing our hearts and full stomachs out.\n\nSuccess! (Mostly luck, actually.) Upon arriving for our 8PM reservation of 10+ people, I noticed a sign off the side of the restaurant that said, \"1\/2 off dine-in pizza on Tuesday.\" And it just so happened to be a Tuesday. Whoo hoo! \n\nReminder: GO ON TUESDAYS! (for 1\/2 off pizza pies!)\n\n\"Less than 14 bucks for a 14\" pizza...? Even for the 'Supreme'?! With sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, AND onions?? Fantastic! We'll take 5 pies!!\" (Really bad idea since a large pie is 8 slices for a total of 40 slices and NO ONE ate more than 2. Leftovers galore...)\n\nBecause I'm a born-and-raised New Yorker who has tried the authentic stuff in Chicago & absolutely fell in love with deep-dish pizza, I'm gonna say that the food was alright but filling.\n\nHere's the downside: Service was pretty slow. Took 10 minutes for our server to show up, 5 minutes to get our drinks (mainly water and soda) and 45 minutes to get our pizza. An hour of waiting.

Revolution House was our most recent spot. The timing was perfect as it was a gorgeous day and Revolution House has a roof deck and happy hour specials. \n\nWe ordered our first round of beers at the upstairs bar and took them to a table on the roof deck. There were about 8-10 beers on draft and the selection is pretty decent. For happy hour, all beers are half off. We were pretty happy campers with a Long Trail IPA and Dogfishhead Indian Brown Ale. We ordered our second round (same beers) and food from the table. The roof deck isn't the most spacious but it's a roof deck and they are a sparsity in Philly. \n\nThe happy hour food special was half off a Margherita  pizza. The pizza was okay...I guess no  real complaints for $6. The crust was light and flaky but the sauce and cheese were inconsistent. The sauce wasn't evenly spread and there were a few blobs of mozzarella scattered around the pie. It was topped with basil but the basil had been baked in and was a little dry\/crispy. I prefer my basil fresh and added to the top of the pie at the end of the cooking process. The pie was a decent size and did the trick for a snack for two people. \n\nThe service wasn't bad. We had ordered our first drinks at the bar then seated ourselves potentially causing some confusion. It took a little bit of time for our server to come visit our table. It was smooth sailing for the rest of our visit and the rest of the service was prompt and attentive. \n\nI wouldn't make a trip across town just to go to Revolution House but if I'm in that part of the city, I wouldn't hesitated to go back from happy hour.","date":"2013-10-03 16:29:20","vector":[0.118165,0.0,0.0,0.1632083333,0.0]}

They're all about being local by using farm ingredients that are locally sourced, freshly prepared items from local producers, and coffee from Iconoclast Coffee Roasters.\n\nTheir restaurant is split into two sections, a cafe on one side and a full-service restaurant on the other side. Their cafe is great for quick items to stay or to-go, including their bagel sandwiches! On the other hand, the restaurant has a menu full of variety. The menu includes breakfast items such as eggs benny, French toast, breakfast poutine. and a frittata of the day. If you're in the mood for lunch, you can choose from items such as bagel boards, soups & salads, and grilled cheese.\n\nMy friend ordered their Egg Cream Soda because it was the most interesting beverage on their menu. The soda consists of fizzy chocolate milk with homemade chocolate syrup. We would both describe it as a chocolate pop. She didn't like it at all and described it as a chocolate milky soda water. I didn't mind it and thought it was a weird and interesting taste that you probably had to get used to.\n\nI tried out one of their bagel boards because who can really resist salmon and house whipped cream cheese in a bagel? For bagel board options, you can either choose\u00a0The Schmear (bagel, cream cheese, tomato + red onion + capers),\u00a0The Mensch\u00a0(same as The Schmear as well as your choice of Sgambaro's Atlantic smoked salmon, beetroot fennel cured gravlax, or lemon coriander cured gravlax),\u00a0or\u00a0The Rooster Platter which is great for sharing between 2 people (includes everything mentioned for The Mensch including all 3 types of salmon).\n\nI decided to go with The Mensch. I had it with a poppyseed bagel (bagel choices vary by day), lemon dill cream cheese (other choices are plain and scallion), and Sgambaro's Atlantic smoked salmon. Rooster Cafe uses Gryfe's bagels from Toronto. These bagels are pre-baked in Toronto, then freshly baked when they're ordered at the restaurant. These aren't your typical Timmy's bagels - Gryfe's bagels are light and fluffy. I turned my bagel into a bagel sandwich and ate it in 5 bites. It was probably one of the best bagels I've ever had! It was delicious, and I was sad that there wasn't anymore of it. I wouldn't say that this is super filling but it's enough to satisfy you. The cream cheese wasn't too heavy or creamy like others, and the smoked salmon tasted fresh! I wish that the bagel boards were accompanied by a small side, though, such as the breakfast potatoes I kept stealing from my friend's plate.\n\nMy friend who is a huge eggs benny lover went with The Rooster Benny. The poached eggs laid on top of sliced bagel halves instead of English muffins. Irving's Farm back bacon was used to sandwich in between the bagel and poached egg. My friend normally doesn't like bacon but she thought this one tasted amazing. For veggie lovers, the bacon can be substituted by arugula and grilled tomato. The benny was topped off with brown butter hollandaise sauce, and came with breakfast potatoes and fresh fruit on the side. Ketchup wasn't needed with these potatoes because they were perfectly seasoned. She mentioned that she enjoyed the watermelon included in the fresh fruit because it was like a taste of summer in the winter!\n\nEveryone knows that brunch is the best meal of the week and it's even better when you can get it 7 days a week! I'd recommend stopping by here for one of their bagel boards because it was so so good (but not that filling so eat something else t00). I'll be back for another one!","date":"2018-03-04 06:53:36","vector":[0.1002847222,0.0,0.0,0.0568090909,0.0]}

My boyfriend and I both love the fajitas form Chili's so it was a natural choice. Our waiter came up and asked for our drink order and we ordered, and about 5 minutes later he came back with our drinks and we ordered out food.\n\nThe food seemed to take forever, but I was really hungry, so maybe my stomach had a hard time figuring out the timing. Another server brought our food, and we didn't see our waiter again until we needed to pack up our food and get our bill.\n\nHe just seemed to disappear. My drink was empty, and I had to ask another server for more tortillas. We ended up having to ask another server to find our server so I could pack up our stuff. I asked to get a side of pico de gallo to take home as well, and he brought the container, left, came back with the pico, left, came back with the bill. It seemed although it would have been much easier for him to bring it all at once (wow, multitasking).\n\nThis Chili's only gets three stars for the amazing food, but the service was a 2 star.

Nice quiet area, found parking along the curb with no problem.\n\nNot busy for a Saturday afternoon, we were the only customers at the time and got seated right away. The restaurant is moderately sized. Lighting was warm. Clean and had Eastern Mediterranean music and music videos playing on both t.v's. Which was fun to view.\n\nWe were greeted right away and sat down and given the menu. Lots of choices and we were a little hangry so we were drooling over the pictures.\n\nService was great. Very attentive. Answered my questions about gluten and dairy. \n\nWhat did 3 hungry ladies order, we ordered:\n-Kubba Halab - deep fried rice croquettes filled with ground lamb (a favourite)\n\n-Dolma - Vegetable stuffed rice. I enjoyed the small wrapped green ones, tart and kind of reminded me of cabbage rolls with the seasoning.\n\n-Fattoush salad (large) minus the pita croutons - nice and tart and refreshing. \n\n-9 skewer mix mashawi - 3 skewers of kafta, shish taouk, tikka beef with grilled onions and tomatoes. All the skewers are delicious. Kafta is my fave. Chicken was tender and not dry. \n\n-Mix rice - The colors of the rice surprised us. Green rice was fun.\n\n-Iraqui bread - I couldnt eat it (allergies) but my friend described it as delicious and chewy. \n\n - FREE complimentary lentil soup for starter.  Delicious and dairy free for a creamy soup.\n\n- FREE complimentary tea at the end of our meal. Black tea with secret blend which the server wouldn't reveal. Served in cute tea cups.\n\n-Beverages we tried were:\n Qamar Deen (apricot) - Suttle fruit taste and tart\nTamarind juice - Sweet and tart\nYogurt drink - Thick and sour cream + yogurt flavour\n\nThe food was delicious and hit the spot. All 3 of us give Zarzor 4\/5  . Probably be returning to try other stuff on the menu. Also got a complimentary coupon for our next visit to receive free hummus.\n\nThe bill was $87.73. So $29.24 a person. I think I've paid more for Eastern Mediterranean food before and it wasn't as plentiful or delicious.

I love Papa Johns, but this store has been by far the worst Papa Johns I've ever had. Not once, not twice, not even three times have I had a terrible experience with this store, but it's been six times of bad experience back to back to back. Every time for 6 times in a row I've waited 20+mins to get a hold of someone to order my food and then another hour and a half+ to receive my food. The first time they forgot about my food so they gave me three large pizzas for free. Thinking that was nice of them, it wasn't worth the hassle of the free pizzas with every bad experience. There isn't another store option to order from for delivery due to my address. This last experience and the reason why I am writing this review is because I waited two hours for my food and it still didn't arrive. I called and was on hold over thirty minutes and they said my food just came out of the oven. While I'm on the phone, my boyfriend went up to the store because we only live 7 minutes away. As I'm on the phone talking to the person that said the pizza just got out of the oven they gave him the pizza and it was a little warm like they had it on a heating rack and not out right out of the oven. We had to go to the store that's only 7 minutes away from our house to be lied to and not even warned they were behind. They said they have one driver, but lied and said the pizza just came out of the oven. If they only had one driver then why was my pizza coming out of the oven 2 hours after I called. I don't appreciate being lied to because they were running behind. This is our last time ever ordering from this store again because we've gave them more than a handful of times to prove us wrong and that it's not just that time of service, but it's every time of service.","date":"2021-01-18 02:16:01","vector":[0.0334375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Pan = bread in Spanish, and a panaderia is a store that sells bread and baked goods aka baker. Paleta = is a Mexican popsicle and through my powers of deduction I would have assumed that a paleteria would be a store that sells paletas, but I was proven wrong last week when I walked in to Paleteria Morelia. \n\nMy mission was to obtain paletas for an evening bbq with some food loving friends. I thought they'd be the perfect addition to the spread, so I went on over to the Paleteria to grab some. The patio out front is really cute with picnic tables, warm colors, and even a little thatched tiki hut to sit under. The store inside is small, with a large chalk board menu showing some of the extensive options they offer, and another big board with lots of pictures shows the rest.  \n\nI expected to walk in and find these incredible Mexican popsicles made from fresh tropical fruits and juices, available in an unbelievable array of flavors and colors. Instead, what I found was an ice cream shop with a large selection of Mexican sweet treats and eats including dorilocos, elotes, chocobananas, and some amazing fruit desserts, but not a single paleta. Helado = ice cream and heladeria is a store that sells ice cream, at least according to Google Translate.\n\nI asked desperately for the popsicles, but there were absolutely none in the store. So after the sting subsided, I settled on some chocobananas, manguneadas, and chocolate covered strawberries rolled in coconut for the bbq, which everyone seemed to enjoy. I'll have to come back and try some of the other items because that patio is too cool for school and I dig the vibe. That's when I'm sure this will bump up to 4 stars! \n\nQuestion for the audience - Spanish is not my first language, so what does Paleteria mean?","date":"2014-05-20 23:50:07","vector":[0.0627172414,0.64225,0.0,0.0883666667,0.0]}

Aside from the agua Fresca they have some yummy ice cream flavors, and delicious real Mexican snacks. As a person who has lived in Mexico, there truly is no place that compares to the authentic Mexican snacks, but Paleteria Morelia gets pretty close. I highly recommend the duro preparado, it's prepared similar to the ones in Mexico. It's made with cabbage as opposed to romain salad, and it has avocado slices too!

Finally got around to stopping in today for lunch on the way to visit my Aunt.  It was a well worthwhile stop.   Safir is located in a strip mall housing many businesses including a Giant Tiger store and a Bingo hall.  Parking lot was very crowded and has a large number of \"15 minute only\" spots, I'm assuming because of the aforementioned Bingo establishment.  \n\nArrived at the restaurant at 11:30am and there were no patrons at the time.  We were greeted by one of the staff who came out from the back.  He asked if we had been to the restaurant before to which we told him No.  So he took some time to explain the menu.   The menu list is posted up above the order counter.  You place your order up at the counter and they bring out your food.   After a few questions, we determined what we wanted.  I opted for the Adana kebab and my dining companion went for the kebab trio which consisted of consisted of Lamb, Adana and Chicken kebabs.   \n\nWhile we waited for our food, they prepared fresh bread for us which was brought out straight from the oven.  As we had not been there before, the person explained our \"balloon\" bread was fresh out of the oven.    It was puffed up like a pillow but when we ripped it open [watch out for hot steam coming out] it collapsed down to something more like a standard pita or flat bread.  The bread was served with 3 dips including a carrot and yogurt one that my friend enjoyed.  With our bread, we enjoyed some Turkish tea and a soft drink. \n\nAfter a short wait, our entrees were brought out.  They were served with a rice pilaf and three types of salad.   Portions were plentiful and the food was very good and authentic Turkish cuisine.  On the way out, in somewhat broken english, the cook asked me what I thought and I told him it was excellent!  By the time we left, there were several tables occupied by people enjoying lunch.  Food must be authentic as we were the only English speaking table of patrons, this is a good sign for authenticity of the cuisine \n\nI will return and try a few more dishes as what we went with this time was quite standard for Turkish food.  For a no-frills solid dining experience, I would recommend Safir next time you are on the north side and are looking for good kebabs.","date":"2018-09-28 22:39:56","vector":[0.1292172414,0.26335,0.0,0.0188583333,0.0]}

I would have posted a picture of the sandwich with this review but I didn't want to make anyone's stomach rumble (and admittedly I was halfway through before realizing I hadn't snapped a pic). I have yet to try their breakfast yet, but you can guarantee I will this week. \n\nNice people, tasty food, and most importantly, beautiful bagels.","date":"2021-06-30 18:57:20","vector":[0.42549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

For this reason I always figured I'll prob never go there, no need to really. Welllll as life would have it we just bought a house at 16th and Carpenter which is a beautiful neighborhood.... without any bars *nearby so when we wanted to celebrate a successful home inspection our choices we South Street or ASB.\n\nI looked at boo and said \"it's now or never baby let's do it\". We walked up to 17th banged a left and shortly after crossing of the Washington Avenue super highway we were there. American Sardine Bar may be a beacon of hope however that has more to do with whats inside than whats outside. The neighborhood looked fine, kids running around, dudes skateboarding, certainly not a sea of despair. So we go in and sit at the bar. It's about 2:30 and its quite an eclectic crowd. Against the bartender's suggestion I ordered a Mardis Gras ale and boo had a boozy cider. I got two sardine sandwiches, and a whole pickle, boo got the onion rings. The bartender was right, the beer sucked however the boozy cider was awesome and almost knocked ol' lightweight off her bar stool. The food was delish and if we weren't going out to dinner that night we prob would have ordered more. \n\nWe stayed for about an hour and a half. After my mistep on my first brew I left my next 3 choices in hands of the tender and brother was dead on. I can really only remember the last one which was an English brown ale from Brooklyn Brewing. It was perfect, exactly what I wanted. With IPAs so prevalent these days its really nice to have something with a little less hops. \n\nGreat beer and food prices and I have a feeling we'll be spending some serious bar time there.\n\n\n*We currently live in Center City so our definition of nearby is a bit skewed.","date":"2014-03-14 17:18:38","vector":[0.08981,-0.1487666667,0.0,0.16034,0.0]}

Then today is your lucky day! Buy lotto tickets! But first, have a Lucky Dog.\n\nIt was only in adulthood that I came to enjoy hot dogs. Even now I can't stomach the cheap ones but the higher grade hot dogs usually hit the spot. Enter Lucky Dog. Like many others I'm going to label Lucky Dog a \"New Orleans tradition\", much like getting hammered on Bourbon St. It's something you do once in your life, like a right of passage.\n\nSo, as someone past the \"let's go to the Quarter and get blind drunk\" phase, would I eat a Lucky Dog (sober)? Probably not and here's why. It's not so much the quality of the hot dog itself, that's something I can handle, but for me the true glory of a hot dog is the fixings and Lucky Dog doesn't even come close to matching some better options on the city. \n\nThe second thing that makes me hesitant to eat a Lucky Dog is the vendors. Well, most like the vendors' hygiene. Or lack there of. I've never seen one of the vendors use so much as hand sanitizer after handling money and food in some pretty dirty French Quarter conditions. \n\nBut if you're inebriated and got one of those random drunken cravings, stumble up to the giant plastic hot dog shaped cart and have a foot long.

I've been eating it since I was a kid, and it's still basically the same recipe.  It's greasy, cheesy, plenty of toppings... so good!  At this point in my life it's more of a guilty pleasure than high quality fare, but I still eat it every month or two.\n\nThis particular location isn't the best, but I've found if you know how to approach it and manage your own expectations, it works out just fine.  First of all, if you call on a Friday or Saturday evening, good luck getting someone on the phone.  They get busy, and a lot of their customers seem to take a long time figuring out what they want and ordering.  Order online.  Their website isn't great, but I've never had a problem with it.\n\nSecond, definitely give them extra time.  If it says your pizza will take 30 minutes, give them 40-45.  For whatever reason they seem to underestimate the time it will take.  Not a big deal if you know what to expect.\n\nI also find this location uses either thinner or fewer slices of cheese.  Even when I order extra cheese, it doesn't seem like as much as I'm used to from other locations.  But it's still really good.\n\nThe people who work there are all generally pretty friendly.  Some are more helpful and efficient than others.  I don't consider this a nice part of town, and there are some businesses in the area I don't feel comfortable at, either because of the employees or clientele.  Jack's is fine.  I always get carryout, because they don't deliver to me.\n\nA lot of the caveats would probably turn most people off of this place, especially if they weren't already fans of the pizza.  But their pizza is so good, and the people are friendly enough, that for me it overcomes the downsides.  4 stars.","date":"2018-07-26 20:03:28","vector":[0.0470142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I put it to the side and tried a piece of lettuce in it.  It was rather disgustingly sweet and inedible.  It tasted of processed chemical dressing.  The part that got in the whole salad I tried to clean up, but it really ruined the salad for me.  The aftertaste was almost painful.\n\nThe crab cake itself was actually quite good.  Almost a hockey puck around but not as thick, it was nice and crunchy with panko bread crumbs.  The rest really was crab meat!  This was satisfying.\n\nThe Cart sells Po-Boys, fried clams, fries, and some other seafood.  \n\n$11 for the crab cake salad.  \n\nI'd come back to try once again, but that dressing has to be dumped in a toxic waste plant.  Ruined my lunch.","date":"2018-05-31 17:26:05","vector":[-0.0507875,0.0,0.0,-0.0844285714,0.0]}

I think it's pretty new there, and really felt like it. I'm at a 3.5 at best here.\n\nStarted out at Park & Rec (this place was pretty cool - need more time there) and didn't really know what to do, found a table with a few people, don't know any of their names but we checked in, got some tickets for our free shots at our 4 stops and a wristband.  After that we were pretty much left on our own.  We were told there would be an announcement and at each place we wouldn't get left behind, yet, we heard nothing and all of a sudden there was a rush of people out of the establishment down the walkway to the first bus that showed up.  I guess that was our announcement.\n\nWe opted for the trolley - that was a fun way to travel a couple of blocks to our 2nd stop, Pour Taproom.  Would have had NO idea who was in charge on that ride had we not been told when people started lining up outside of the first spot, we wanted to take the trolley anyway - we were told who was the leader of the trolley, I don't even remember seeing her on the trolley - no introduction or anything...\nSo, at the 2nd stop, no free shot here, as they only do beer and wine, which is totally fine, no biggie, no points lost here.  But, after both busses emptied everyone off at the same time, there was a HUGE line out the door with no explanation as to what was going on - what we were waiting for, etc etc.  Once we got in, we learned what it was about (This is kind of a serve yourself kind of place) and not soon enough was the ride to the 3rd spot...\n\n3rd stop Grateful Fed Pub, again, everyone out at the same time, rushing the bar for that free (nasty) shot of something.... and at first the service was really lacking, but I guess as the crowd lessened at the bar, they were a little better, so I'll blame that on the rush...but overall, the place wasn't great and service was non existent outside, had to get up and order food at the bar and if you wanted another drink had to get up and order at the bar...  Anyhoo - all of a sudden the place emptied out.  We were still outside when we were summoned to hurry, need to catch the bus (or trolley), my friend was still eating her wings...when we got out there, there was no trolley...it was missing!  They didn't know where it went....  So, it did show up again, and we all got on and we got to the 4th and final stop....\n\nLast stop Hofbruhaus...right across the street from stop #1.  We were later than the first group so we venture in and were directed upstairs.  There's no one there!  We went back downstairs and then learned that the group was on the other side upstairs.  There's the noise and the chaos!  There's the free shots and everything.  Well, we find a table between 2 other tables doing beer pong....gotta say, I didn't really like the ping pong ball bouncing between all the tables into our faces, but it only happened like 2 or 3 times, so it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  I liked this place, first time here.  We did get to sit with our trolley leader, who was nice and all...  Had some beers and food, OMG the food took FOREVER!, and by the time we finished, everyone was gone...so we took our time and then headed back across the street and to our cars.\n\nOverall, it was fun.  It was not cohesive.  I didn't feel like I was part of the rest of the group.  Had I gone by myself or not met up with a few people I already knew, to meet new people, I would have left after the first, definitely by the 2nd stop.  They offered free giveaways, raffles and games (there was beer pong at a couple spots, which was the only thing they did and I'm not into) in the description of the event but they did not actually provide them, they say because it was a free event (free to get the word out, etc)......then don't advertise it for that event!  Or do it so you get the full experience and know what to share with people when you talk about it.   I am glad they offered the ride for free this time.\n\nI think this might get better but wouldn't spend 6 hours out of my day to do this when I could go with friends and do the same thing on foot and at no cost...\n\nI might be interested in trying the Tampa crawlers and see if it's any better or more organized...  I might even be willing to retry St. Pete and give it another shot...","date":"2018-02-19 13:05:00","vector":[0.0846090909,0.1742428571,0.0,-0.0056409091,0.0]}

The quantity was quite good for the price I paid but unfortunately the food was tepid for a cold day, but no problem! I have a microwave so I heated the food up. The noodles were not soggy and the vegetables balanced quite well. The key to the taste seemed to lie with the condiments though. I added the sweet sauce, the sriracha, and the soy sauce (all provided) to get that trifecta of flavors (they have a lime too but I'm not too big on sour). That balance really went well with the texture of the noodles and chicken. However, I don't think i have ever struggled so hard to get that soy sauce packet open (no scissors, so when I finally found the magical sweet spot to tear open the packet, it kind of bursted... onto my table... and keyboard.... just be careful... :)\n\nAnyways, definitely worth trying once to see how you like it.","date":"2016-05-17 17:48:06","vector":[0.0188529412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The cro-muffin was excellent, if a bit hard to eat with way too much filling. The filling was not too sweet. The cro-muffin itself was not perfectly flaky, perhaps from the abundant filling? Nonetheless, it was very tasty, and I ate it all in one sitting. My husband's cookie was HUGE (well, for $4, I guess it should be). He thought it was \"okay,\" but \"too much chocolate.\" Well, that's proof that tastes differ!\n\nPrices are on the high side, but these are beautiful pastries made in-house in South Tampa, so I think they are appropriate.

A few blocks from State Street. Great location!\n-Friendly staff. Aaron was super helpful and answered everything we asked.\n-The gift basket for a 2+ night stay was really convenient. Fruit, banana bread, granola bars, the works. Handy to put in a backpack for a hike!\n-DVD library if you feel like staying in on a night. Make sure you watch The Usual Suspects!\n-Beach cruiser usage throughout the day\n-Stocked kitchen\n-A huge floppy cylindrical pillow that my girlfriend adored for some reason. (No, honey, we aren't sleeping on that pillow. Yes, that was a real conversation)\n\nCons:\n-Found a couple silverfish wandering around. Not a big deal to me, but might be to some people.\n-The main reason for no 5 stars: noise from the street and thin walls. Not all rooms will be near the street, but we had Room #1, and as such, we could hear every car that drove by. We could also hear the TV and people talking in the next room over. Luckily, we weren't in our room much, but it also makes you conscious that you might be too loud when you're talking as well.\n\nWould recommend this place if you're looking for something a little more homey.

But today, I decided to bite the bullet to give one of the restaurants downtown a try for a quick lunch.  I landed at the Iguana Cafe.  It is not a fancy place.  In fact if they had not had signs in the window with pictures of food, I would have assumed it was just a dive bar.\n\nI decided on the Chicken Burrito with green enchilada sauce.  It was very tasty.  You could taste the heat just a bit, but my no means was it spicy hot.  It was packed full of shredded chicken.  I sat at the bar and was checked on several times by the waitress and the owner.  It was obvious that most of those in the shop were regulars and that is who they cater to.\n\nI thought the price was reasonable for what you got (my experience is that downtown tends to up price for the privilege of being downtown).  I would have liked a side of rice and or beans.  I saw that it was listed under a Side order heading and I would probably do that next time.\n\nI am not bar hopper, so I asked what sodas they had, and she started rattling off the list.  She barely got started when she said RC.  I stopped her because it is my favorite but not common in Tucson.\n\nAll in all a fine experience.  This is not a place I would take a date and it is really rough and not impressive, but it was a fine for a quick bite.  I wouldn't mind coming back sometime again for lunch.","date":"2017-03-04 01:31:04","vector":[0.02023,0.0,0.1806,0.0104583333,0.0]}

No long line like last time. Downside was that either they just didn't prep anything or I came right after a huge rush, as they were missing two of the five items I wanted (Broccoli Beef and Mixed Veggies). Given this particular location, I would consider both possibilities equally likely. Because there was no one behind me, I opted to wait. \n\nIn the four minutes it took for them to get a fresh batch of veggies and broccoli beef, they forgot every single request I made for my order. They packed up my order to-go (I told them I was dining in), and they put the broccoli beef into a separate container (I told them they could just pile it into the box). They were also about to walk away until I flagged them down for a pair of chopsticks. This immediately became problematic as the broccoli beef was set upside down in the bag, causing the gravy to leak out onto everything. Again, I ate this in, so it was about six paces to the table to unpack the contents of the bag. There was little to no possibility of the contents jostling sufficiently to create the spillage.\n\nI will reiterate my points from my first review. The food is fine. It's super cheap Chinese fare made with expediency in mind. You can create a pretty healthy yet flavorful plate for a reasonable price. It's this particular location that's an issue as apparently they managed to hire the least competent folks in Tucson. I've had no issues with the location in Park Place Mall, which is my other primary location, but I go to this store only because it's on the way home from work when I'm at my hungriest.","date":"2017-02-14 20:37:16","vector":[0.0114333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

It's close to work, food for the most part is decent. However,  from my experience yesterday and today I will never step foot in their establishment again. I called placing a take-out order for a chicken fajita salad. I was told 15 mins. I arrive to an almost empty establishment, 4 people at the bar and a couple at a table by the entrance. It takes the bartender a second to notice me as she was chatting with a sever and when she does she smiles grabs my food and greats me. I hand her my card and she goes to the back of the bar and runs my card. Simple enough it took her normal time to do this. I sign, leave her a tip and leave. This afternoon I went to check my account. I noticed my account was debited from Moxie's for $14.08 AND $36.68.  I was like wtf my salad was $14.08. So I call, when the phone was picked up there was a conversation in Spanish for a good 30 seconds before I was greeted. I asked to speak to the manager. When the manager came on he seemed simply too arrogant to deal with my situation. He said the girl told him about running my card for a bill that wasn't mine and they had voided the transaction. I was trying to ask how on  earth can you run someone's card twice for two separate bills and not notice or not even tell me when it came to me signing my receipt.  He told me it's happens and was a mistake. Now, I've bartended and waited tables in extremely busy conditions never once had I rung up someone's card for another persons meal.  There was no apology from the manager only him stating his bartender was good people. I pointed out to him this seemed poor business practice as well as something sketchy going on because the bartender knew me and that I work simply a couple doors down. I asked the manager for a copy of the voided receipt. I was then told that he  isn't sure if there is a copy of the void. How on earth can you void a fraudulent charge and not have some sort of paper trail? It seems like I was simply betrayed into paying for someone else's meal and drinks and they got caught.  A simple apology and a copy of void would have had me returning as a customer. Not this run around.

The first time we ordered, the food was a bit late, but everything was delicious. No real problems there. \n\nThe second time around, things were less ideal. The food was late, and we realized when we unpacked everything that we were missing over $15 worth of food. At that point, however, we didn't want to deal with waiting for the rest of it while our food got cold, or otherwise having dinner part 1 now and part 2 who-knows-when. So we called the restaurant and just asked if we could get that food taken off our bill (especially since what they forgot was just the $7 bread basket and two $5 orders of samosas). But, after waiting for several minutes while the man who answered the phone conversed with other people, he very nearly yelled at us that, no, we were not getting a refund; he was sending the driver out with the rest of the food, whether we liked it or not (and he unceremoniously hung up on us as soon as we finally accepted that we weren't getting that refund). So we just ate what we got (which involved chicken makhani with many inedible chunks of gristle), and, lo and behold, the rest of our order arrived over an hour later, leaving us at 10:30PM with appetizers and bread for a meal that was already eaten. For an order made at around 8.\n\nFor what it's worth, the food here is generally great (save for the quality of my chicken); the pakoras, both vegetable and chicken, are great. The meat samosas are awesome. The naan is good. The palak paneer is very good (albeit light on the paneer). We just were very put off by the service.","date":"2018-02-15 23:27:12","vector":[0.11065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

My favorite is cherry coke! \n\nThings kind of went downhill from there for me, the other worker there (ethan) was rather short and when I mentioned that the address was wrong on the website he cut me off and told me I was wrong.

So it was definitely wrong) \n\nI also didn't notice until I got home that he gave me the wrong extract that I had bought to take home.

When I am just browsing, the staff quickly ascertains this and backs off, but when I have questions I have found that you can engage them on a wide variety of topics and they are passionate about food and cooking.  Best of all, if they don't know, they will gladly pull over another sales associate who does.  The best part is that they will have in depth conversations with you about their experience with the product, other products you can use (some much less expensive), and give you honest tips on how to get the most from your purchase.  Plus if\/when you need to return a defective item, they go out of their way to make it painless and pleasant.\n\nSorry some have had negative experiences, but with the new shift in CA sales tax laws for the internet, I shop at WS.  I may pay a little bit more, but I can engage with fellow food lovers, and they have a great return policy.  One final tip: Joan is amazing.

They also have some seriously good sales tables most of the time, in virtually any and every season.\n\nThe staff is a bit hard sell. They need to pay attention to each other (I don't really want to listen to the same daily or weekly specials spiel from one person and then literally take two steps and be told the same thing from two other salespeople. This happens all the time and they aren't busy enough to claim they didn't see another sales person approach you.) \n\nThey also need to take some ownership of their line\/counter situation. If you stand at the counter and follow he sign that says \"Form line on other side\" you shouldn't have to stand there and wait while a salesperson rushes to help people who stand on the wrong side of the counter. In non-busy times, take that sign down and PAY ATTENTION to the people who arrive at the counter while you're just standing there behind it. It's frustrating to be helped third when you've been standing there alone for five minutes and virtually ignored and then someone goes to help someone who hasn't heeded the damn sign. \n\nThis isn't something that's happened once or twice, it's nearly every time I'm in there. \n\nThe pros to this place is that they really do have the best of the best of culinary equipment and supplies that you can find in a normal, to-the-public retail place in SB.

Anyway, my husband contacted Breville, who said they cannot do anything without the original receipt.  We did not still have the receipt, as we loved the oven, and had decided to keep it.  We took it to the Williams Sonoma store to see if they might have an electronic copy of our receipt somewhere in their system.  We printed our bank statement as proof of purchase from that store back in December.  Tina, who helped us, was so kind.

Of the places we've been to, we've never found a place that met all of our expectations as far as the meat, the sauces, and the sides.  This place also fell short of meeting those expecations.\n\nAMBIENCE- the place looked like any bbq joint you would go to down south.  Nothing fancy by any means, just wooden tables and table cloths.  The place was well lit and the bathroom WHEW.  I've seen a bright yellow, but that area rivaled the sun as far as brightness.\n\nSERVICE- so unlike most bbq joints down south, they actually had table service.  I'm used to places where you order, pick up, and sit down.  The place wasn't very busy, so service was pretty good.  Our server was very friendly and it sounded like she knew her stuff (we overheard her talking to other customers about questions they had).\n\nMENU- The place seemed to be more Memphis style, though they did have brisket which is typically a texas thing.  They had your typical variety of meats- pulled pork, pulled chicken, ribs, brisket, sausage.  Sides were pretty common too, though no sweet potato casserole.  The menu was broken into sandwiches, dinner plates, and family meals.  Sandwiches ranged from $5-7, dinner plates $9-15, and family meals started at $20.  They also had a la carte and a catering menu.\n\nFOOD- One of the first strikes against this place was their lack of cheesy potatoes.  Our server told us they instead had fries, but not your \"typical\" fries, these ones had a garlic flavor to them.  By garlic she must have meant salt, because that was all I could taste.\n\nFor dinner the wife went with a 1\/2 rack of ribs, mac n cheese and a salad.  I went for the two meat sampler (pulled pork and beef brisket) with mac n cheese and those \"special\" fries.  My wife's salad was nothing special, and our mac n cheese seemed very much like velveeta.  It seemed to creamy to be home made, but perhaps that's just how they do theirs.\n\nAs for the meats, nothing really blew my mind.  My wifes ribs were rather dry although were for the most part tender.  My pulled pork was ok, though it seemed like it had been sitting for a while.  The brisket was also dry, and rather uninspiring.  I guess that's what the sauces are for, right?\n\nThey ahd 3 sauces- spicy mustard, original and hot.  I will say the \"hot\" did pack a kick to it but for the most part was as average as the original.  I'm not a fan of the mustard base sauces, and the spicy mustard didn't do anything to change that.\n\nOVERALL- not the best, though not the worst.  For people that haven't been to a true bbq city, I imagine this would suffice.  As for the wife and I, I doubt we'll be going back.  The prices were decent, and the portions were ok, but I just wasn't digging this place.  The search continues.\n\nMovie Star Rating- Larry the Cable Guy","date":"2009-03-30 15:56:41","vector":[0.0344410256,0.25784,0.0,0.0243230769,0.3612]}

Someone had forgotten about my corn on the cob side so it didn't come out with my ribs.  I asked and it came out with the second helping.

Can Tho City offers the classic campus food truck experience - order the food, wait a couple of minutes (more or less depending on how busy it is, with peak hours being around lunch), pay for your food in cash, then find your own place to eat it. \n\nThey had a notice that as of Feb 1st 2020, they had to raise the price of all the items by $1 because of rising food costs (which is actually similar occurrence every few years among many food trucks nearby). So the banh mi are $6 and platters are $7 (platters come with water bottle). So the prices are still decent but it starts being comparable with Chipotle, which is my benchmark for all meals.\n\nThe banh mi is delicious and flavorful! Slightly smaller than I had been anticipating but I was still full at the end of my meal. \n\nOne final quick note that I've been noticing more lately regarding hygiene is that the lady preparing the food only uses one glove, and occasionally touches bread etc with the un-gloved hand. If you're particular about that stuff, might want to consider when you visit here.","date":"2020-02-03 18:38:32","vector":[0.0305416667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

If they call out the order, and you're not there, chances are someone else will step up and take your order (happened to me).

I looked over the menu and knew I wanted an Acai bowl. I was torn between berry and blueberry. Before tackling a beverage selection I asked for help deciding between bowls. The employee helping me took a moment to explain the difference between the favor profiles. He suggested berry if I wanted tart and blueberry if I wanted sweet. Tart sounded perfect so I jumped on the Berry Acai Bowl.\n\nNow for a beverage. Nothing jumped out immediately. I wasn't seeking energy or focus or anything specific that would make a choice from the menu easy. I explained I wanted something light and refreshing for overall flavor and clean juicing. A strawberry lemonade with apple was suggested and sounded great. \n\nThe beverage was ready quickly and upon first sip I knew his suggestion was perfect. There was ice but only enough to chill the juice. It was perfect. The apple lent a sweetness and the lemonade added the bite. I love tart beverages so this was perfect.\n\nI took the bowl to go. I ate it less than 20 minutes later. I popped it in the fridge for a few minutes when I got home so it remained the same chilly temp it was in the store upon delivery. The first bite was sweet and tart and gooey deliciousness all in one fell swoop. The granola added a great gooey texture in the midst of the the smooth acai flavor. The scattered bites of blackberries and bananas were a great treat. I demolished the bowl in what felt like mere seconds. It was filling and refreshing at the same time. \n\nDuring the summer I often don't feel super hungry due to the hot temperatures.

It really is a market-cafe, as its full name and logo say.  We walked in and were met with glass display cases showcasing some of the fresh food items available for takeout.  Lining the walls were the market items, consisting primarily of condiments, wines, and similar types of sundries.  All were relatively unique, or at least not the types of items to be found at the local supermarket.  Fascinating to peruse, actually, or even to purchase.  It's a relatively small, simple & clean layout inside - but still has a nice atmosphere.  In the back is a fairly spacious covered patio.  We would have enjoyed our dinner out there, but with it being a muggy evening, we opted for an inside high top table.\n\nWe ordered at the counter from a fairly limited menu - 7 small plate choices, 7 large plate choices, and a charcuterie board - but that worked out well for several reasons.  It was easier to decide what to get without being overwhelmed by options, there was still plenty of variety, and it allowed the kitchen to focus on quality and still serve it quickly.  What with ordering at a counter, I expected a quick serve type of experience like at St. Louis (Panera) Bread Co.  However, it turned out to be just like a full serve restaurant, except that you place your order first and get to decide where you want to site.  All food and drink was brought to our table and served, drinks were refilled for us, empty plates were cleared away for us, and the owner\/chef came by early to detail the components of our charcuterie board as well as plate selections - nice touch.\n\nSo we ordered the fried ribs small plate, the bahn mi tacos large plate, and the small charcuterie board.  For drinks, we simply had water.  Now for the details...\n\nFried ribs - If you like ribs at all, you have to get these.  Rib meat itself was tender and juicy, while still flavorful.  The light breading and frying added a complexity that I enjoyed.  But then, I like dishes that mix several layers of flavor.  A little dip into the accompanying Alabama barbeque sauce throws a little creamy-sweet-tart on it, but you just want a little dip.  If you like plain, full rib flavor, it won't necessarily be for you - but if you want a more involved experience, get these.\n\nBahn mi tacos - Pork belly, napa slaw, pickled onions, hoisin mayo, corn tortilla.  All the ingredients were top notch.  What really got me, though, were the big thick slices of pork belly.  They were cooked up to not quite crisp, which was just right for a taco filler.  All the cooked flavor, while still holding the shape and easy to bite through.  If you're a pork belly fan, this is for you.\n\nCharcuterie board - Salumi, cheeses, pickles, olives, mostarda, flatbread.  All were locally sourced if possible.  A nice selection to start off the meal with light choices that primed the palate.  I thought item was a little pricey at $13 for the small board.  But I can understand the cost when considering the individual items.  Plus see below re. the bill.\n\nDessert - There were cookies, cakes, and macaroons available in the cases.  Macaroons it was!  We picked a few pistachio & raspberry ones.  I tell ya, freshly prepared (I'm guessing some time earlier that afternoon) blow away anything you get that is packaged.\n\nAlmost forgot the water!  It comes in a jug that they also fill with fresh mint leaves and a freshly cut lemon.  Nice touch for something that has no charge.\n\nAnd the bill....  When you place your order at the start, the ticket is left open so that you can add small plates, desserts, etc. as you dine.  When we were finished, I went to the counter and paid, using a credit card.  The receipt was given to me to sign, but there was no place to add a tip.  I thought about writing it on the bottom and just adding it up, but instead pulled out some cash from my wallet and put it in a little tip jar on the counter.  As I did so, I said to the owner (who was ringing us out) that there was no place for the tip.  He said that he was trying to change the world and didn't have tipping.  Instead he just paid the workers a living wage.  I mentioned that I preferred to have the prices reflect the actual cost myself, which he said was also the idea.  Funny thing, though, was that the prices didn't seem especially high to me.  Certainly not any more than I would have expected had tipping been a part of it.  I also (jokingly) said that I should have mentioned the missing tip line on the receipt before I tossed some in the jar - but I did leave it there.\n\nMy experience - 5 star.  Maybe yours won't be, but I would guess that it will be close.","date":"2016-06-14 13:59:48","vector":[0.105092,0.0,-0.0493333333,0.0943115385,0.0]}

Probably over the years we have been over 100 times. Well, I'm there today and have a coupon for three foot longs. They know me there, I'm polite and always leave a tip. Now, being a guy I have very rarely used a coupon but my wife handed it to me and I said okay. The manager was standing right next to the lady when I said I needed three footlongs and showed her the coupon. She was very rude and said tersely, \"we don't accept coupons or promotions.\" No let's face facts, it's Subway, your there for an acceptable sandwich that is convenient. Franchises are not required to honor coupons but they are required to have a sign or inform you before you order. If they treat a regular that way I'm guessing everyone gets the same service now. It's good bye to this Subway and hello to Jimmie John's and Jersey Mike's. BTW I saw Cory posted the same issue but never looked at comments for here as I've been there many times.","date":"2022-01-03 19:53:08","vector":[0.4144,0.0,-0.0258,0.0,0.0]}

Why not keep it open so you can see all the empanada magic making happen?\n\nAnyways, we were planning to go to dinner elsewhere so we just wanted to sample a couple of empanadas.  We ended up only trying:\n- Seafood ($2.99) - decent amount of seafood in this empanada.\n- Ham and cheese ($2.99) - pretty plain, nothing special. We weren't impressed with this one.\n\nFor the price of $3\/empanada, I wasn't impressed.  To compare, a place I tried in BA that is known for their empanadas was charging $1.50\/empanada and they were stuffing their empanadas.  Also, there's no deal if you order one versus a dozen (I asked) so I can't really justify buying 3 empanadas when I could get a full meal from Mama's right next door.

The chef somehow managed to transform the usually boring spinach filling to a very tasty interesting Empanada. \n\nThey also give you a cheat sheet so you can identify the Empanadas, each Empanada has a unique shape and somehow made the dining experience more interactive.  \n\nYou can also buy them frozen and bake them at home, which is something that we will defiantly do in future. It is perfect for a lazy day. Most of Empanadas are 2.5 $ and they are not small at all.

I've tried their smashed peas, garlic mash potatoes, fries, and medium spice chicken. Medium is actually a decent amount of spice so start there.  Food is delicious.  You can get the bottles of peri peri sauce to add extra sauce, so if you need more spice add the hot level sauce after!

Then you go up to the front to order and pay. One thing that I don't like about this system, is that you are expected to tip before you have gotten your meal. The woman who took our order was friendly. She went above and beyond and gave us a pitcher for water so we didn't have to keep going up to refill our glasses (drinks, cutlery, napkins, and sauces are self serve). \n\nThe restaurant itself is colourful, bright, and comfortable. \n\nThe woman who brought our food just dumped it on the table (she didn't even put our plates in front of us) which was disappointing. We ordered the classic share platter, which consists of a whole chicken, garlic bread and your choice of side to share. We chose the hearty cole slaw. When the food arrived, the coleslaw had tons of creamy dressing (too much) and was very basic: just cabbage and shedded carrots. When it was described as hearty I would have expected some nuts and seeds or something in it. The chicken was tasty, moist, but a but oily for our liking. The garlic toast was yummy: buttery crispy goodness. The portions were large. This dish costs $31.49, which is reasonable for two. \n\nOverall we found this place just okay, and the model of ordering to be kind of annoying.","date":"2019-01-13 21:06:26","vector":[0.0578217391,0.0,0.0,0.0323285714,0.0]}

Located in the brewery district near Starbucks, the parking was difficult as there were no spots and cars around everywhere.  I also find the parking stalls a bit tight.  There are way less people during the evening in this shopping area.  I assumed the restaurant would be busy for 1:00 based on the cars but it was less than half full.\n\nWe were greeted by a friendly staff member who seated us.  She gave us the menus and explained how to order.  Once we were ready, we went to the till with our order and table number.  The drinks are self-serve and a station is set up with cutlery, napkins and a hand wash sink.  Our food arrived quickly, we enjoyed the whole wheat chicken wrap with medium spice which I found burned my tongue a tiny bit and I can eat spicy food.  I really liked the dressing for the lettuce, cucumber and tomato and the chicken was so tender and flavourful.  My side dish was the sweet potatoes which was a little different with pepper and nuts sprinkled on top of the slices.  The other item we tried was the chicken Caesar pita with garlic mashed potatoes, the pita was nice and fresh and the potatoes were real, not smooth and instant looking.  Our wrap and pita was $8.35 each and  you have a choice to add one side or two.  I do find the side dishes a bit small though.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and quiet at this location with the Afro-luso music playing, not hectic like the south side one.  The tables are spaced apart with enough privacy and enough room for people to walk by.  The restaurant, kitchen and washroom was clean so you know the staff takes care of this place.\n\nI'll be back to try other menu items soon!

I have frequented this Starbucks many times in the past and have had a variety of experiences, mostly pleasant. The staff is usually courteous, and the store itself is clean. There aren't many seating options, but most people tend to grab and go, so typically there are seats available if you'd rather sit and stay awhile. During my most recent visit, I just ordered a tall coffee. I tried paying through the app, but their phone scanner wasn't working. They were extremely apologetic and since it was just a coffee, they didn't make me pay. It was very kind of them, and they have excellent customer service. One thing you should know about this location, though, is that you can't take advantage of special offers through your app and they don't accept free drink rewards. You can still collect stars, though! \n\nI usually have a good experience here, but after a recent visit, I need to update my review. A few friends and I came here for frappuccinos and were all super disappointed with our orders. I got the caramel frappuccino and there was no flavor. It was basically just a cup of blended ice topped with whipped cream with a drizzle of caramel. My other friends also noticed the lack of flavor and terrible quality of their drink orders too. I don't order specialty drinks from Starbucks often (since they're so expensive), so I was extremely disappointed to not get my money's worth. There did seem to be a new employee there I did not recognize, so hopefully that was the only reason.

As this is a good location to meet up with friends (somewhat in the middle between north side Edmonton and St. Albert), I frequent it about once a month. Every single time there has been some level of let down... either the baristas plain ignore me standing at the counter (for a full 6 min), or they don't listen close enough to my order and get it wrong (twice), to the bathrooms not clean on a regular basis, and the cramped feeling inside. Generally I find the employees disrespectful towards patrons and I have even had the manager make me feel uncomfortable in a situation.\n\nInside is small and there are not many tables, the decor is standard, and the lighting is dim. The one bright spot in this review is that I have never had issues with the drive thru. Overall I would not recommend this location for your Starbucks fix unless absolutely necessary. And definitely not a good place for studying or relaxing due to the cramped space and lack of lighting.","date":"2012-09-28 14:14:28","vector":[0.0,0.03614,0.0,-0.0618642857,-0.0191]}

The main problem is the lack of power outlets. I'm lucky to be sitting by one of two available. The rest of the tables would have to stretch an extension cord, if they've got one.\n\nThe environment is a little dreary, and I've been here on nice days too (still dreary). I guess I'm not particularly enamored with the character of the place. It's close to a lot of good shopping if you just need to take a break for coffee, or for a short business meeting.\n\nBusyness - Mid-morning and it's fairly steady at this location. All the seats are taken. I am betting the drive-thru is popular.\n\nNoisiness - Not too bad. The music is relatively quiet, so people don't have to yell above it.\n\nAmbience - One thing I haven't ever liked about this location is that it's poorly lit. There's plenty of light coming in from the front windows, but the rest is under-lit, giving it a bit of a dreary feel.\n\nPower - Luckily I'm sitting by one of the two power outlets available to any of the tables. The tables in the centre of the room are out of luck.\n\nFree wifi - Available and works well.\n\nStaff - Always friendly, of course. \n\nSeating - There are only 16 seats, but room for more at this Starbucks. There are a couple tables outside also. There aren't any larger tables to work on, though there is room for a couple more. There are two arm chairs and the rest are flat wooden chairs.\n\nSecurity - Seems to be alright here. I think it's mainly wheeled traffic to this location.","date":"2010-08-13 17:30:45","vector":[0.0,0.2779666667,0.0,-0.06353,0.0]}

Staff had a very \"I couldn't care less, I don't want to be here\" attitude. They were out of what I wanted (passion tea), and when I asked what else they had that was similar, they didn't really have any recommendations. When they finally thought of something and I accepted, the lady who made it did a terrible job. It tasted like lightly flavored water. I refuse to pay 4$ for lightly flavored water. What a joke! I asked to have it remade (I have had the very berry hibiscus at other locations and it's delicious so I know what it SHOULD taste like) and got a pissed off look from the woman who made it. So much for any customer service. It was remade by the guy and it was a little better but still not what it should be. Don't worry Manager (whoever you are), I will not be stepping foot back through your doors ever again and I will make sure no one I know does either.

Hash browns were included in the burrito which is unusual.  I would've liked to have seen the burrito grilled or served warm.

My boyfriend and I went for dinner three times in the last three years, typically during restaurant week. The first two times the food and service were good and we had a very enjoyable time, which is why we went back. I particularly liked the outdoor seating and the extensive wine list. \n\nLast year we went during restaurant week for our anniversary, as it had become kind of a fun tradition, and it was hugely disappointing.  It definitely was much more crowded than during previous visits, but they stuck us all the way in the back in this little room that contained about four tables and an enormous big screen TV with football on! Considering the fashionable image the restaurant wants to maintain, it seemed out of place, and was less than romantic for us. If we wanted to watch football, we could have had our anniversary dinner at sports bar. Moreover, my boyfriend's steak was underdone to the point of being cold and raw. The waitress was so inattentive\/ busy that she ended up bringing our dessert course out before we could tell her the meat needed  to actually be cooked so that we could eat the entree. By then enough time had elapsed that it was basically too late to bother, and she didn't deal with the screw up well, or offer a discount or anything. I'm pretty generous and easygoing about service, but it was bad enough that we didn't tip, and won't be going back this year.","date":"2008-08-14 00:12:46","vector":[0.0,0.30295,0.0,0.059425,0.0]}

Anyway, Patou is cool inside - funky decor (especially the chairs), lounge-y, nice ambiance.  The wait staff and bartenders were all very nice.\n\nThe white sangria with peaches was very good (we got a pitcher).  The food was good - I got the Moroccan salad (hummus, greens, pita wedges, and two other hummus-like dollops whose names I forget).  My boyfriend got the mussels, which were good, and my friends got some other appetizers (one inhaled her tuna tartar, so I assume it was very good).  For the main course, I got the couscous (which was couscous with chickpeas, peaches, zucchini, carrots, and lamb).  It was very good, although the lamb was fatty and a little tough.  My boyfriend and other friend got the steak dish, which was perfectly cooked and had the best scalloped potatoes ever (it had gruyere in it).  Overall, everyone's meals were good.\n\nThe dessert was delicious.  I got bananas with ice cream and chocolate on them (the bananas were warmed), as did my friend, my other friend got a delicious peach pie type thing, my boyfriend got a sorbet with vodka poured over it (he liked it, but I thought it was a bit strong), and my friend's husband got a caramel dessert that he really liked.  \n\nIn all, the meal was very good.  I had a nice time, and I think I'd go back again.  I was just disappointed that the \"Patou Salad,\" which is on their regular menu, wasn't on the Restaurant Week menu b\/c it's got softshell crab in it, and I looove softshell crab.  But no biggie.  I'll just have to go back another time.\n\nThey also have a happy hour from 5-7 p.m. that features $4 sangria, $2 beer (a particular one, but I forget which one now), and $1 oysters, crab legs, and shrimp.

It looks like a little mom and pop diner that has been around awhile and the menu had enough variety that I think anyone can find what they want.\n\nI had the western omelette meal that was an omelette, toast, hash browns, toast, bacon AND sausage for $12. Best deal in town! The omelette was made with whole eggs, not the fake ones that come from a carton and look flat and rubbery. The amount of food I got was ridiculous and I couldn't finish it and it was just damn good down home cooking. I will absolutely be stopping here every time I am across the street for service and will be sending my parents there as I know it is exactly what they would love and the price they can afford. \n\nI plan on popping by for a lunch in the future!

The portions are large, the prices are very reasonable, and everything we ate was fresh and delicious.  The lentil sambusas and the Ethiopian vegan platter were outstanding.

There is not more than one bite per persons of 4. Of course we had wine the choice of beverage, we decided on the house Sangiovese house carafe. The carafe was not filled rather is was half full. The pours of wine are extremely small. The carafe only provided 4 short pours which total 2 good pours of wine. As for dinner, I chose the wood fire pizza, I was carving this since I had not had a wood fire pizza since Italy 2008. What a disappointment. The pizza was a good size just like Napoli, but the dough was not cooked long enough. The center was like soft bread instead of the beautiful black charred spotted crust you should get. The flavor of the sauce was nothing to shout about, it was bland. Other in our group order a 2 pasta dishes and lamb dish. The pasta dish again, was on the extreme small portion side, like an appetizer plate. They actually asked for more bread because they were still hungry. And the Lamb don't even get me started, it was 5 thin slices of meat in a little sliver metal dish. My opinion, and I know this is what it is, don't even think about it...............run, run far away and choose another Italian restaurant in the area. Whoever wrote the glorious review must have mistaken this one for another or needs to retire from writing restaurant reviews. I will not be returning.","date":"2015-01-19 13:35:47","vector":[0.0207032258,0.0,0.0,0.0979944444,0.1901]}

We were easily able to get a reservation on Opentable.com for Sunday evening at 7:30pm for our party of three--which I was a bit surprised about until we got inside! The renovation of our old favorite (Karina's) included a second story dining room with ample seating (including presumably larger parties). Admittedly, there were few (if any) tables on the first floor that could accommodate 3 guests--and if I were dining as a party of two I would eagerly request the first floor space (for all the smells and fun kitcheny things to look at).\n\nI was most excited to try Brigantessa equally because of our recent month in Italy (and still not feeling like it was enough!) and the ability to order \"wine on tap\"! I am a sparkling wine kinda girl (with prosecco as my all time favorite) so I went head first into ordering their bubbly option. My husband and his Mom are beer connoisseurs and although I am not sure what they ordered I know they enjoyed their selections.\n\nI was not incredibly impressed with the first glass of house sparkling wine but the second (non-daft) option was better--but pricey. \n\nThe food we ordered was delicious but I have to dock points for portion size. I don't know many Italians who would be impressed by the dollar to spoonfull ratio which was disappointing to say the least. Brussels sprouts dish consisted of 7 sprouts cut lengthwise was friggin tasty but ultimately a bit hard to stomach at $9. We also had some amazing cheese and honey and salady things, but, again, only one or two bites per person. I can't remember now exactly what they were because the only thing I took away from the situation was that I--literally--wanted more. The pizza was good but, again, small. Cue food snobs here: \"what did you expect\", right? I don't know. To be full after $200+ for 3 people?\n\nThe most absurd part (and then I will end my rant) was $30 for 3 gelatos. Yes. You read that right. And although it was good, I will hardly say that it seemed worth it. I guess I just don't know how so many people can afford to eat here. Personally I was relieved (and guilt-ridden) that when the bill came Mom was the one footing it. And I'm practically 30. Oof. \n\nOverall this is definitely a quality over quantity meal. You might want to rob a bank and eat a bowl of cereal on your way there. Or figure out how to expense it! (P.S. If you do any of those things please invite me with you because it WAS delicious)","date":"2015-02-17 20:06:58","vector":[0.04865625,0.0,0.3291,-0.02195,0.0]}

It's a huge step up from its predecessor, Karina's, which wasn't good and a huge eyesore. We made reservations and said we were celebrating a special occasion, and upon finishing our meal our server comped us some excellent cannoli. This fare is VERY traditional Southern Italian. No fusion cuisine here, and thank god.\n\nThe Good: The food is delicious and authentic, the ambiance and decor are updated but still have an \"old country\" vibe, the staff is super friendly and accommodating, and the food (yes, twice) is that good. \n\nThe Bad: Pretty minimal, you may get a bit of sticker shock at first, but it's worth it. The place can be a bit cramped downstairs and upstairs, and a bit noisy upstairs. They don't serve beers in pint glasses, which weirds me out, but whatever. Also, this place is newish, and it seems like they're still working out some staff kinks. I'm sure they'll get there. \n\nThe Ugly: None. There's nothing about Brigantessa that screams stay away. This may be a great spot for a date, for a few drinks, for a pizza, or to hang out with friends. It's probably not the kind of place to have a quiet, intimate dinner with a few family members.\n\nThe Babby: if you have a kid, that's cool. this is one of those places where the atmosphere changes with the time\/day. if you're going with a kid i would recommend the upstairs dining room at the start of dinner service. if you're upstairs between 5:00-7:00 you'll be mostly alone, or dining with other folks in the same family dining situation.","date":"2015-04-02 16:27:21","vector":[0.1053444444,0.23835,0.0,0.1336272727,0.0]}

We were greeted by a gentleman behind the counter and he directed us to a booth table. The first booth we sat have crumbs all over the table so we moved over to another table. He gave us a lunch menu with one side cater to Thai food and the other Chinese food. The menu is quite simple with some popular dishes. \n\nWe settled for thai food and ordered pork ribs, spring rolls, and stir fried noodles. Lunch entree comes with soup and salad or noodles ($1.50 more). Luckily, we didn't order our own lunch because their serving was big enough to shared for two. Overall, the food was decent because their Thai dishes taste more like Chinese. It would be really nice if they can completely separate the taste in both dishes that they offer. \n\nIf you want something quick and affordable, I'd recommend this location.","date":"2017-11-22 02:40:59","vector":[0.0873142857,0.0,0.0,0.0566666667,0.0]}

That said, my last order from them was completely lacking in any spices\/herbs at all, and my previous order was lacking the pineapple that is advertised on the menu for that dish.  They were probably confused when I ordered the dish \"mild\".  I meant that it should not have too much of the hot chili paste that burns a person's tongue and covers up the other flavors.  I'm not sure they understand that when Americans say \"mild\", we are still hoping to get all the other spices and flavors in the dish.  In the future, I will make sure to explain that I only want the hotness level to be mild, but not the flavor level.

Pretty good I thought. The chicharron had a lot of flavor and the presentation of the huarache was nice, with beans and cabbage. I thought to myself I had to come back. The salsas they had to offer were really good too, packing a punch. More roasted and more thick than most salsas.\n\nMy next trip I ordered chalupas and a chicharron taco. Chicharron taco was as good as I expected and I liked having more chicharron in a concentrated bite than what the huarache offered. The chalupas had flavorful lightly deep fried thick corn tortillas and the shredded meat on top was really good. I had to be back again.\n\nThe next time, I ordered a cemita but they were out of the special bread so I just got it with the torta bread. Not bad, but something felt a little off. I thought the milanesa was just a little breaded too much or didn't really feel right. But I loved all the ingredients, the abundance of avocado, the slices of ham, and that crunchy South American vegetable I had never heard of. But perhaps I had come during a downtime and they weren't warmed up yet.\n\nI came back during a busier time and ordered the cemita again along with a gordita rellena with of course chicharron. This time the special bread was here and it really made the whole offering pop with that delightful crunch but soft and savory inside. This time the milanesa was fried perfectly and had crunchy parts while having that delicious pork flavor. The gordita rellena was like a pocket full of chicharron. Finally I was able to take a bite that was able to get all the glory of the chicharron. Delicious leaner and fattier parts as well as crunchy and soft melt in your mouth parts. Absolutely amazing.\n\nEl Antojo Poblano, you are a real treasure.","date":"2019-11-10 01:39:09","vector":[0.1738818182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

He was waiting for us with lots of yummy food and photo books for us to look through. (may I add that his wife had just had a baby a few days before the meeting- I was impressed by how awake and in tune he was). From the first meeting, I knew Kevin was someone we wanted to work with. He has a very calm and kind manner to him. This definitely is great on the day of the wedding when everything seems to be moving so quickly, he made you take a deep breath and chill out. Kevin's second in command, Heidi, was also awesome and very caaaalming. While they were both very calm, they also kept us on task and kept us moving to make sure we got all the shots we wanted in a timely manner- but it didn't feel rushed. I have received countless compliments on our photos- they are beautiful. The USB drive with all the photos that he sends in the mail (in a very timely manner) is super convenient.

I loved their style, reached out to Kevin, and we booked an engagement session. \n\nLeading up to the session, Kevin gave us a lot of tips for what to wear\/bring for our outdoor shoot. The session took about an hour, and we had the chance to walk around campus and take photos in a variety of spots (Kevin had also scouted out the campus before we met up with him, so he had some ideas that we hadn't though of which turned out great!). \n\nWe got our disc of images about two weeks after the shoot, and it had 75-80 high-res JPEGs for us to print or use in creating save the dates and other photo projects. Kevin also put our images on the photo hosting website Pictage, which allowed us to share all of the images with other people (ie, our parents) who might want to order prints. The session plus the disc and photo release was only $350. I found out a few months later that wedding photographers will usually do your engagement photos for free once you've booked them for your wedding, but we missed that boat (still vetting photographers for our Baltimore wedding) and $350 seems more than reasonable. \n\nKevin was a joy to work with. He was funny, helpful, patient, and also let my fiance and I relax and just hang out with each other while he took candid photos. He has a great eye for creative shots and we are in love with the portraits from our session!

I searched for food spots nearby and almost as if it was prewritten in a book by the Lord, Prince's was the first place to pop up . I looked at their menu and a faint smile crept on my face as I saw they had a chicken parm sandwich on their menu ( I knew this would be a night I would remember). Let me tell you the night just got better and better. I preordered the sandwich over the phone and the server couldn't have been more amicable. When I brought the food home and opened the styrofoam container holding this precious meal, a plethora of aromas reminiscent of the innocence in my childhood struck my face. The cheese was perfectly placed. The chicken was flawlessly crispy. Every single attribute of this sandwich was finished to perfection.

I won't  stop going, I love pizza, punk, and I'm  a vegetarian.  It's exactly what the S. Grand strip needs.  However, I've been there several times and each time the quality of pizza is a little different.  I havent had much issue with single slices, except for sometimes they'll give you a slice that's 50% air bubble and...for the price per slice I want more than a pocket of air. (If you ask for another slice I've had no issues!)  \nMy issue has always been with ordering a full pie, to the point I won't do it anymore, unfortunately.  They're  not cheap for one, we ordered spinach, garlic, black olive, sausage, pep. The toppings were fine, the veg sausage is a lil weird...bland.  Idk if they make it but throw some italian spice i to thae mix, my friends!   The veggie pepperoni though?  ON POINT FOR REAAAAL.  Any way,  The pizza was over $40 which is (sort of) understandable due to size and veggie meats are typically more expensive but they don't  really pile anything on...so the topping prices can get really steep for...not a lot of substance.  \nMy issue is moreso with the cook time I guess...?  I get its a NY style and supposed to be floppy  but every time we get a pizza home its so...floppy, wet, greasy (I honestly can't tell) that the slices don't pull off from the pie, the dough is either undercooked or so moist it all sticks to the box and we have to scrape it out.  I'm  assuming It's  partly due to them being super busy and not having time  to push bigger orders out fast enough while taking care of lobby orders but IDK. \nI'll probably try again and again and hopefully get this bad boy up to 5 stars but for a $40 pizza, the entire thing needs to be consumable and not stuck to the box. \n\nPersonally, I love the atmosphere.

In other words, it wasn't busy and we sat at the bar and expected to have a beer and just relax. We were going to the comedy show across the street afterward.\n\nAs we sat the bar, the bartender basically tossed the beer menu at us and walked away. A few minutes later, again the place was pretty empty, she came back and asked what we wanted and seemed annoyed we even wanted to order a drink. She took our order and came back a few minutes later.\n\nAt that point she gave us our beers. She gave my wife my beer and me her beer. Jill, my wife, mentioned that she mixed up the beers (not a big deal to us but just in sort of fun way) and she stared at her, totally annoyed, and walked away not saying anything.\n\nSo, we just drank our beers, talked to a nice guy at the bar beside us, and had a good time. When we were done, we asked for our bill. She basically ignored us and walked off. Another bartender, who was friendly, asked if we wanted anything a few minutes later, and we said we'd like the bill. She then came up and said, \"Oh yeah, I forgot\" and again seemed annoyed.\n\nAfter putting in our bill for 2 beers, she turned the tablet for us to pay. It was 8 bucks a beer (which seemed high compared to every other brew pub or brewery we've been at in Tucson) and then the base tip you could give was 20%. Jill and I almost always give 20% because we know that the hourly wage for service people is horribly low and they depend on tips to survive. However, she didn't deserve an extra penny but we were forced to give her a $4 tip. \n\nSo, for 2 beers, horrible service, and nothing else it cost us $20. That is absurd. We will never go there again and will make sure everyone we know will not go here also. There are way too many other great places to go to in this city and we've always been treated with respect and treat others with respect and always tip 20% even though many of the tablets\/receipts start at 15%.\n\nThe place looked so cool and we had such high hopes...sadly, nope.","date":"2020-02-18 17:33:29","vector":[-0.0127375,-0.17615,0.0,0.14221,0.0]}

We planned our wedding in December and were hoping to find a caterer who could provide a fun and seasonal menu and not the typical fish or steak wedding options. After emailing with Ashley I immediately felt comfortable with her style, prices and loved her suggested menu options. We scheduled a tasting with her soon after that. Ashley offers a really unique tasting option. She comes to your house and cooks for you! After the tasting Ashley worked closely with all of my vendors, made helpful suggestions to improve my ideas and agenda and ensured all of my decor and extra touches were executed. On our wedding day, there wasn't one thing that was out of place or forgotten. Everything was exactly (probably even better) than we had hoped an imagined. Her staff was extremely attentive to us and all of our guests. I never had to go to the bar or look for an hors d'oeuvre all night. Before I noticed my drink was even empty or that I was even hungry, one of her staff members would appear with my drink of choice in hand and a sampling of food. We also had a few older guests with mobility issues and her staff went out of their way to check on them and get them food and drinks throughout the night. When the wedding was over, I could not even count how many people raved about the food and complimented on how nice, attentive and fun the staff was to them.

She was always available, flexible and happy to answer our questions and provide recommendations.\n\nThe tasting was prepared in our home (!!) where we basically hung out while she worked in the kitchen.  We tasted everything that she planned to serve, plus a bunch of options that she wanted us to choose from.  We had a couple of tweaks to the menu which she was more than happy to accommodate.\n\nWe decided to do homemade desserts, so a bunch of family members baked cookies and treats and we dropped them off in tupperware to the venue.  We weren't sure what to expect as far as presentation, but we were totally impressed - she had set up a long table with all of the desserts laid out on blocks (so there were levels and depth to the display), and had put some beautiful decor around it.  You would not have believed it was all homemade.\n\nAshley also casually mentioned that our package included a cheese table - again we were shocked at how amazing and beautiful it turned out!  There were cheeses, fruits, meats, spreads and a bunch of different crackers and breads.  It was perfect.\n\nAnd then there is the food!  Everything was delicious, and people have since told me how amazing it was, how there was plenty of food (this seemed to be a worry when I told everyone that we weren't serving a seated meal).  Some people even mentioned trying to recreate some of the hors d'oeuvres at home.\n\nFinally, the service.  This was truly outstanding.  Ashley provided a staff member to help oversee on the day of, and she was one of the highlights of the experience.  She was always quick to offer a glass of water (or champagne), escort us somewhere private when guests began arriving (early!), and make sure that we were happy, comfortable and had everything we needed.  She also made sure that all of the guests knew where to go and what to do, so we didn't need to worry about that.  The other members of the staff also looked out for us all night - ducking out from behind the bar to make sure our drinks were full and that we were taken care of.\n\nI really cannot say enough great things about Ashley and Power Catering.  They are a huge reason that our day went so perfectly.  If I ever have a good reason to throw a cocktail party (and a budget to go with it), I will 100% jump at the chance to hire them again.\n\ntl;dr\nPower is amazing - incredible service, delicious food, tons of knowledge and happy to be flexible and work with you.

However, after quite a bit of traveling and a few years under my belt I've realized not only do I love cheesecake but I love a specific kind of cheesecake.  My style is semi-sweet, creamy, yet thick and dense enough to stay leftover on your utensil.  I am here to tell you - Hank's Cheesecake did NOT disappoint!  If you are like me with your cheesecake preferences, you likely hate Cheesecake Factory.  I can assure you that Hank's is far better than the Cheesecake Factory and you will be in love with their product after just one bite!  Not to mention, they have a WIDE variety of flavors to choose from. \n\nA couple negative things I would like to share in hope to improve Hank's future business would be:  \n\n1) In regard to wedding clients, forget any and all personalization for your big day.  My entire wedding was custom - down to the Wedding Programs.  This was not to be different for my Wedding Cake either - I wanted Cheesecake and Ice Cream Cake, rather the traditional \"Wedding Cake\".  With that, I didn't want to compromise the presentation of my cake because of the non-traditional route I took.  All personalized requests were immediately rejected, to include but not limited to:  Square Cakes, Swirly Design of Icing Decoration, and Special Ribbon (outside of their Silver or Gold options).  Now, the square cakes I can understand especially after confirming the level of baking difficulty with my Executive Chef.  But, the swirly design rather splatter shouldn't have been an issue.  The pearl & champagne colored ribbon shouldn't have been an issue either.  I mean at least a commitment to check with her supervisor would have been a practice of customer service than just \"NO\".  Overall, my cake looked fantastic thanks to my awesome Cake Topper...\n\n2) If you are an out-of-state wedding client, don't bother unless you have a ridiculously high level of tolerance and patience.  It felt like I was a chore to the store by asking them to email me rather call.  Being in a different time zone and utilizing more vendors than the average Bride, I **needed** the email trail to help jog my memory and for a reference later on.  This was a struggle the entire time.  In order to book my date and finalize my cake, I had to send two different people to go in person and sign papers.

We had two small pizzas, a pepperoni and one of their specialty pizzas, Chicken-Tomato-Basil.  The pepperoni was an okay St. Louis style pizza, but that Chicken-Tomato-Basil has to rank up there among the worst pizzas I've ever had.  Truly awful, due to the overabundance of dried basil.  I guess I could have expected they wouldn't have fresh basil, but they really ought to try their own creations sometime and they'd realize you can't put that much dried basil in one dish.  I can't believe anyone would think this is good.  It almost goes without saying the tomatoes were of standard low-end restaurnant quality - light pink and flavorless.   Here's a hint for Smugala's:  Grape tomatoes.  Get them at Trader Joes and stop using those horrible pink things. \n\nWe also got a small chef salad, which was nothing special.

The crew themselves are often reason enough to stop by.\n\nOf course, the most import thing is the food and this is where the place truly shines.  The menu features a wide variety of Po-Boys(and regular specials) and Stews which contain some of the tastiest-made Cajun food I've had.  You truly can't go wrong, but for a first visit, make sure to check out the sausage Po-Boy and get some corn bread to go with it.  The first time my wife and I bit into it, we both got that slack-jawed look of astonishment at how great it tasted.\n\nAdditionally, any order which is eaten in the restaurant as opposed to take-out will give you access to all you can eat sides, which can easily be a meal by themselves in terms of taste and selection.\n\nI don't have enough superlatives to properly recommend the place, so just go and check it out.

They raved about Nyeisha (the owner) who warmly welcomes you into her home and adapts a standard American restaurant menu into meals made with all fresh organic fruits and veggies. There is no dairy, wheat, soy, or any animal products in her food. Most of the menu is completely raw but you can ask for a cooked dish if you prefer.\nThe place I heard about, I guess what used to be her home, was moved to Germantown ave. It is a very spacious lovely cafe with very eclectic furniture. You can order dishes in small (a choice of 3) or large (a choice of 5) with sides or main dishes.\nOne of my favorite things about eating at more natural places is fresh juice and fresh tea. One of my biggest pet peeves is bagged tea. Yuk gross.\nWe got fresh apple cider and chamomile. Our appetizers: sea green salad, sprouted chick pea hummus, quinoa salad marinated with cilantro and fresh veggies (this was awesome!). Sprouted wild rice with kale and a hot dish-the sabgi-mixed veggies cooked in Indian spices. Last, the raw lasagna made with raw nut cheese, which was also a good size and ended up being too much food!\nThe dishes were prepared all wonderfully over a bed of greens. Everything was flavorful and was the most interesting date I had in a long time! I'd have to say 5 stars on the presentation. Not to mention the dessert menu is fantastic. Raw cheesecake and carob cake WOW melts in your mouth. also Nyeisha comes out and talks about the dishes with you, letting you know what's in them and asking you what you think. She catered to my allergies and was very respectful and interesting. Her website is truly inspiring. Her bio explains how the western diet had affected her health and she had cured herself of diabetes, obesity, and depression by returning to raw cleanses and a healthy lifestyle. It is rare to find places like this on the east coast and not have to go up to New York.

Truly a great geek dilemma.\n\nMy first trip to Board N Brew was somewhat spontaneous; I was climbing the achingly steep 103st hill on a very hot summer day and just as I reached the apex of the mountainous hill I saw the shining taps of draught beer and rows and rows of games.

What truly sets Board and Brew apart, however, is their food and beer. They serve Battista's Calzones and have a number of local beers on tap from Yellowhead, Situation and Alley Kat. Honestly the food and beer here way exceeds the usual board game cafe fare and rivals pub grub at other bars. \n\nThere are also some smaller details that are fantastic such as the board game difficulty ratings that they pulled from boardgamegeek (a website\/forum for board gamers) and various game-themed pictures and decorations around the place.\n\nBoard N Brew is an excellent place to indulge in food, beer, and friendship and its central location guarantees I'll be visiting again soon.","date":"2017-07-18 20:04:06","vector":[0.1288,0.4939,0.0,0.1714,0.0]}

You order at the counter and they deliver it.\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.","date":"2018-07-17 03:30:07","vector":[0.0327714286,0.162275,0.0,0.0734375,0.0]}

My favorite was (conveniently) my own dish. I had the special, which was a proscsiutto wrapped some sort of meaty white fish...I want to say sole...(this was a week ago...) with crab meat flaking around it and covered in beurre blanc sauce. I think my mouth just started to water while typing this...\n\nThere were also scallops, pyramid pasta, squid ink pasta, and the ragu. All perfectly excellent. The dessert left a wee bit to be desired. (Gelatto in an espresso cup is not, like, the most exciting thing in the world.) But I'm still giving five stars for such a nice evening.\n\nThe outdoor summer ambiance was totally charming.

Next to that, they had a variety of drinks including fresh lemonade, orange juice and more. I decided to pick up the stuffed croissant with ham and cheese as well as the lemonade. The sandwich was also kept under a heat light so when I sat down and ate it, it was nice and hot! By the cash register, they have a variety of fresh baked goods including croissants and cookies. I decided to try the chocolate croissant as well.\n\nAfter paying, I decided to get a nice seat at a large booth they had. I started off with the stuffed-croissant, which was excellent. The ham was nice and tasty and the cheese added a nice secondary flavor. The chocolate croissant was also very nice as the chocolate itself was superb. I also had the lemonade and while it was very fresh and tasty, I wish they had it in a larger size. It was only 13 ounces and it was the largest drink they had. \n\nThe staff here was also very nice and polite. They checked me out efficiently, but I did not feel rushed.\n\nAlso, they should probably do something about the backdoors as they swing back really fast could potentially cause an injury. \n\nAltogether, Pret is a great edition to 30th Street Station as it serves great food along with friendly staff!","date":"2018-03-04 15:50:26","vector":[0.190548,0.4939,0.0,0.0602142857,0.0]}

Our waitress was friendly and efficient and everything. The cheesy grits could be better. They're kind of dry and thick. Could be a little creamier but the pancakes were delicious and my friend ordered the strawberry orange juice and he said it was delicious. But my complaint I have with this particular location is their process for seating. There's no clear, distinct sign that says where to put your name on the list. We waited for a while before being told by the hostess seating people that you had to visit the counter to be added to the waiting list. There's a young girl with a tablet in front of her just standing there not paying attention to anyone who walks in the door. If it's your first time visiting this establishment you'd be totally confused. They should definitely have a better system. She eventually took our name down and said it would be 30-35 minutes for 2 people. That's interesting because the bar counter had plenty of empty spaces. We waited for about 10 minutes and we still ended up being seated at the counter which was previously empty when we put our name on the list. Not sure what time frame the hostess was on but she was clearly confused but don't know why it took us even that long to be seated when there was seating available immediately. I also noticed a couple that came in after us was seated at a regular table before us. Made my experience less than stellar so I probably won't be back anytime soon just based on that.

The noodles had good flavor, but the broth wasn't as rich and flavorful as I wanted, and the pork slices were tasty, but pretty thin. All in all, it's OK ramen, not great ramen.\n\nWe also got in right under the buzzer for happy hour, which meant downright cheap sushi. I went with a few nigiri options, and their \"roll of the day\", hamachi with cucumber. All were good - the nigiri portions are absurd, with huge slices of fish that realistically should be used to make two pieces of sushi, but I guess I shouldn't complain. All the fish was pretty good - tender and flavorful. Tuna especially was a little oilier than normal - it can be a weird texture when it's super lean like meguro can be. The special roll was also excellent. I love yellowtail, and this was good yellowtail, plus I liked the crunch of the cucumber. Price for this is super reasonable, and the quality was fine, definitely nothing sketchy here.\n\nThis is going on the list for when I need some noodles.

I started with a Greek salad - also amazing. Ample amounts of feta, pita to soak up extras, flavorful dressing. Loved it. I also snagged a bite of saganaki (flaming cheese) and greatly enjoyed it!  \n\nI got the spanakopita. It was delicious! Two large pieces with a side of tzaziki for dipping. Definitely tasted fresh - flaky pastry rather than chewy, lots of spinach and feta taste. I couldn't eat it all and took some home. \n\nThe service was great - despite having a group of 12 and there being other diners (and one waitress).

But in the end, I couldn't dish out higher than a 3 - let me start from the beginning.\n\nWe were part of a big group for a friend's birthday party. The table was ready when we all got there and we had a good spot relative to the stage. The live music all evening was simply fantastic and a real treat.\n\nA few of us shared alligator as an appie, which wasn't too bad. Like a cross between chicken and calimari. It was a little pricey, but delicious all the same.\n\nOur server, Kathleen, was very friendly. She was pretty pushy with the alcohol, but it was kind of funny. (IE. My husband ordered a glass of wine and she asked him if he would like a bottle instead.) If you're ordering a martini, though, definitely supersize you order. It's $12 for a 2 oz or $24 for an entire pitcher!\n\nThe food was out of this world. I had the country fried chicken. It was very good, and the accompanying mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had (but don't tell my mom I said that)! I also loved the slaw the came with it. Light, kind of tangy. Yum!\n\nSo up to this point, everything is going swimmingly 5-stars. I'm stoked to go home and write my epic review of NOLA. And then this happens:\n\nMichael and I asked for our bill, since we were leaving before the rest of the table. The server gave our bill to me. I noticed at the bottom of the bill that the gratuity was included in the final total. That was because we were part of a large table, which is fine with me (although she probably should have said something at the beginning of the night or when she brought the bill over). I pulled out my credit card, but she said I would have to pay on the machine up at the front. That was no problem, and I started putting on my jacket and gabbing away at everyone.\n\nWhile I was saying goodbye to friends, Michael went to the front to pay our bill (which I didn't realize). Instead of re-printing the bill (which I still had in my hands back at the table), the server told Michael she remembered how much our bill was, and punched in the final number to the card machine. What she did NOT tell him was that the final number already included tip. So he went and added on 15% on top of our with-gratuity-total, and she never said a word. It wasn't until I finished chatting that I realized he had paid, and it wasn't until we got to the car that we realized what had happened. I'd like to give the server the benefit of the doubt and I hope it was an accident, but not telling your customer that gratuity is included in their bill is a major mistake to make.\n\nGreat night out, but definitely not worth our final cost, and I'm still angry about the way the night ended.","date":"2011-11-25 15:23:42","vector":[0.2792636364,0.1559166667,0.0,0.1292058824,0.0]}

A little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for.\n\nIf you want freshly prepared fish and chips in YEG with all kinds of healthy options for sides, then this is the place for you.\n\nI went to Grandin Fish 'N' Chips for lunch with my wife.  If you want to eat at the restaurant (instead of take-out), then you'll have to arrive early because it fills up quickly. So go early!\n\nI was very fortunate that the fish of the day was Halibut - not normally on their menu.  My wife had the pan fried cod.  We were both very pleased with the taste and quality.  My wife gives their tartar sauce a 10\/10 - which is shocking coming from her!  Anyhow, back to the food.  I substituted the fresh cut fries for some delicious \"FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUT BUBBLE & SQUEAK\", which were great, however the chips were fabulous too.  I recommend you try the Brussel Sprouts if you are into that kind of thing.\n\nThe fish was freshly prepared to perfection.  Don't expect huge portions here.  You're not going to get three pieces of fish with your order - like Joey's Only or fast food fish places - just one serving\/piece per order.\n\nGrandin Fish 'N' Chips is NOT a fast food place by any measure.  It's like a high end restaurant with a casual friendly atmosphere.  So if you want the best quality fish & chips in Edmonton, look no further. (Menu and prices: https:\/\/grandinfish.ca\/menu\/ )\n\nJOMT - My wife and I were discussing whether or not this little gem will last.  She thought it would because there is nothing else like it in Edmonton.  I'm a little more pessimistic because I know how costly it can be to run a restaurant and maintain such high standards.  In the end we agreed that if we want high quality restaurants to remain in Edmonton, it's up to the citizens to support them.  We have and will.  I hope you feel the same so the owners and staff will remain committed to their high standard of excellence.\n\n(I'll be sure to take some photos next time)","date":"2017-03-07 21:14:12","vector":[0.142895,0.1585,0.0,0.2246,0.0]}

A Saturday night.  Reservations for 8:30.  Place was packed and we weren't seated until around 8:50.\n\nThe restaurant is loud.  And by loud I am talking Monster Truck Rally at the Superdome loud.\n\nStarted with an off the menu appetizer of the day jumbo lump crabmeat au gratin and housemade potato chips and the on the menu mussels in a green apple remoulade sauce.  The crabmeat was pretty delicious with huge chunks of crabmeat (however to steal a spot-on line from Jason D.'s review, the potato chips had \"enough salt to dry up Lake Pontchartrain) but the mussels were tiny and were not up to par with other restaurants in the city.\n\nFor entrees our table had: Fish of the day - Red Grouper, Lobster Risotto and I had the fried softshell crab.\n\nI didn't try the red grouper but it got high marks.  I am not a fan of risotto but I tasted it and for me it had a strange herbal flavor like tarragon or something unpleasant.\n\nMy softshell crab came out like a piece of artwork that should be displayed in a museum.  We even took pictures.  If only it tasted as good as it looked.  Heavily battered I could barely taste the crab over the batter.  The corn maque choux smelled horrible and tasted worse.  Like a salty pile of pan scrapings.\n\nWe got some vanilla custard tart thing for dessert which I cannot remember the name but it was pretty good.\n\nExtensive wine\/champagne list and full bar.\n\nThe staff was accommodating once we were seated.  \n\nI would have no objections to returning and trying different things on the menu but with so many options in New Orleans I will not be rushing back.","date":"2014-08-25 08:56:15","vector":[0.0482652174,0.0,0.0,-0.0705571429,0.0]}

Tends to be a messy, kind of sloppy take on a classic \nThe pretzel bites - really yummy, only $3 with beer cheese during happy hour \nThe bruschetta- tasty, but the bread to bruschetta ratio is off. It's a tiny amount of topping. \n\nAs far as dessert, I've had their cannoli and their soft serve, both have been good.","date":"2017-10-11 22:41:36","vector":[0.17021875,0.1646333333,0.11418,0.0,0.0]}

Was let down by the Veal Breast Milanese hoagie, it seemed to have been WANTING to be a really good Chicken Cutlet hoagie, but it was just wasn't happening. (Nothing beats a KILLER chicken cutlet). The Mortadella hot was surrounded by a claim of \"It will be the BEST HOT DOG YOU EVER ATE\" - sorry, but it's not.

It has some really quality coffee with some interesting combinations such as the lavender latte.  There were a couple major issues that I have the largest being that their menu wasn't posted up on their chalkboard which makes no sense as before you open this should have been done. We are left then to ask the staff about their menu of which even they themselves seemed unsure and the only way that I could figure out what the order was by going on yelp and looking through the photos to find out what people had previously ordered.  The other major issue I have is in dealing with the seating there's one really big table that is directly where you enter the coffee shop so anyone that is sitting in those seats is directly backed up to the people entering the store to order coffee. Other than that they do have some soft chairs and couches for you to sit on.\n\nThe Impression:  The major thing that I think needs to happen at this store is to work on their professionalism the staff should be more knowing of the product that they are selling and basic things like having your menu listed should always be done prior to opening.","date":"2016-08-27 00:29:21","vector":[0.063475,0.0,0.0,-0.0077444444,0.0]}

Even better is that I discovered that their coffee shop is a 2 minute drive from my house! I stopped by over the weekend and was greeted with smiles from all the staff. I had a chai latte while Scott had a hazelnut latte with a Pumpkin Feta muffin. Yes ... pumpkin and feta! While it might sound odd, this combination makes for a balanced breakfast \"treat\" that isn't too sweet! I also liked the feta because I can't eat food with cheesecake ... it is just too heavy and leaves me feeling kind of ill afterwards. The feta while still decadent was not overwhelming at all!\n\nThe chai latte came with two options: the homemade chai or the powdered mix. I chose the former and boy was I glad! Chai lattes are like soul food for me. I often order this drink and find it to be just a giant cup of warm sugar. In this case, the spices took center stage and the drink was not overly sweet. I asked for skim milk and they did a wonderful job with the foamy\/frothiness - I realize that is probably not as easy to do with skim milk as it is with 2% or whole so I was impressed! The drink was creamy, soothing and just the right temperature. \n\nWhile the location isn't very scenic, I really enjoyed sitting down and relaxing.There is enough seating to give people the chance to relax and stay for a while :)","date":"2015-12-21 17:37:29","vector":[0.08055,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

He knew I was looking for something fun to do with all of our family that was coming in for my graduation from Vanderbilt Divinity School. We weren't sure if they were open yet so I stopped by to check. The market is very near our house I was pleasantly surprised to find the owner there. She was friendly, engaging and informative. She told me about my options in addition to her culinary experience which included graduating from the Culinary Institute of America and many years as a chef in fine dining restaurants in Nashville Tennessee. Her experience allows her the ability to be flexible in planning what you need for your event. I told her about how much I wanted to spend per person, which for me was $15, my guests dietary restrictions and we arrived at a menu. When I picked the food up last Friday I was very impressed with what I saw and smelled before I even tasted anything. The curry chicken entr\u00e9e we ordered for dinner came with six different toppings. Additionally the salad we picked out was delicious & delightful. The mint tea punch was a little bit sweet so I recommend just adding plenty of ice. My favorite part was probably the strawberry lemon yogurt cake which was made from scratch from fresh local lemons and strawberries. Everything from here was made from scratch. My second choice in our neighborhood for my graduation dinner would've been J Alexander's where we probably would've spent literally 10 times as much money. I am very happy with my choice to have this event catered by Bergamot. The quality of the food and the value was superb. They officially opened the on-site market today at 7 AM and I'm looking forward to trying more of their sandwiches and salads.

The Lighthouse Bar & Grill, conveniently located at Pontchartrain Landing if you're a guest there and inconveniently located at Pontchartrain Landing if you're not a guest there, is an exception to that rule. The keyword is \"strange,\" not \"bad.\"\n\nI went there with three friends on a Tuesday night. We were the only people there other than the (minimal) staff. We went for dinner, not necessarily for drinks, though we got both. The drink options were limited, but they were pretty cheap, which was nice. The food options were more diverse, but they were somewhat more expensive. And everything that we ate was at most average.\n\nTwo of us ordered the same thing: the steak with the potatoes and something else that comes with it, steak medium-rare. Somehow, in both cases, the steak came out well-done. Where that got lost in translation, I couldn't tell you--our waitress was nice enough, though I sensed that she sometimes failed to understand what we were requesting to eat or drink, even though we were reading from a menu. Maybe she was new. She was nice. Okay. Anyway. I just remembered that the \"something else that comes with it\" was a gumbo that my friend took one bite of and said he would've returned it if we weren't his company (two of us were NOLA visitors, two longtime residents). I don't remember what the other non-local person got, but I know that I got \n\na) spinach and artichoke dip b) Caesar salad, no meat. \n\na) You know how spinach and artichoke dip just can't be bad? Because it's literally spinach, artichoke, a bunch of dairy products, and chips? Aka a bunch of amazing things melted in an oven and mixed together? The chips were the best part, and they were nothing special. To be clear, the dip wasn't bad. It was just melted cheese with spinach in it. It was ordinary, which by proxy and in this context is bad. Frankly, Lighthouse Bar & Grill should be fucking ashamed.\n\nb) Caesar dressing isn't supposed to be sour, right? I'm not high, I think? Because this Caesar dressing was SOUR. Not bad, again, just sour, which was unexpected. It was still okay enough to eat, but like...no. Just no. No one wants a sour gosh dang mix of lettuce, parmesan, and croutons. The word you're looking for is \"creamy.\"\n\nIt was bizarre, not bad, which is why this isn't a one-star review. Lighthouse provided me the most ordinary, inexplicable, verging-on-bad meal I've ever had. Since we were staying in the motorhome camp, we went back another night or two for frozen margaritas, which were actually pretty good, another reason this isn't a one-star review. Though it really should be a one-star review since the only news channel playing is Fox News, which was a way-too-right-wing TV channel even before the current \"president\" made it his propaganda arm littered with fake news and, when the news isn't fake, incredibly biased with bigoted takes and the most misguided views possible. I just got off-topic, sorry, but yeah, when you're in New Orleans go eat at a French Quarter classic like Cafe Du Monde (for beignets not meals), Mr. B's Bistro, Cane and Table, Killer Po Boys, Domenico's, Clover Grill, just not this. Unless you're staying at the RV camp, in which case, just go in with measured expectations and don't look at the TV that has the news on, the one with Weather Channel will give you a more realistic take on the world.","date":"2017-12-29 23:28:43","vector":[-0.03161,0.0,0.0,-0.1194285714,0.0]}

I was impressed that I went back again. \n\nCan't wait to comeback on a cold day. Now that would be a delicious bowl of pho.","date":"2021-10-11 03:04:28","vector":[0.0817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

It sits on Franklin Mills Drive, one of the access roads around the now \"Philadelphia Mills.\" The room is spacious and utilitarian; comfortable and attractive in a Spartan kind of way. \n\nI sat alone in the back corner to give myself and everyone else sufficient space to remove our masks and feel confident in this renewed COVID social environment. The room wasn't crowded, but there were enough customers to keep the staff busy. They were efficient and friendly. I ordered Chicken Lemongrass Dumpling Pho and the Roast Pork Banh Mi, and settled in and waited to be served, sipping a plastic glass of hot tea (orange pekoe?).\n\nPHO - I liked the variety of noodle soup offered on the menu. The choices were much broader than just traditional spicy beef base and thin cuts of steak, tendon, meatballs, etc. The Chicken Lemongrass Dumplings were plentiful and very good, even though the lemongrass flavor was not pronounced. The complexity of the stock could have been more subtle as well, but with the addition of jalapeno slices, Thai basil and squeezed lime wedges, it was a solid enjoyable slurp. The nest of thin rice noodles beneath the surface were tender and held the broth well as I sucked them up through whistled lips.\n\nBANH MI - Excellent sandwich on very good french demi baguette, stuffed with lots of roast pork, cucumber, carrot and daikon strips with sprigs of cilantro across the top. It was a solid bite and chew, made better with a light touch of combined sriracha and hoisin for extra punch and smooth smokey sweetness. Definitely, one of the better banh mi's I've enjoyed in the past few years in Philly. \n\nPho Nam Giang has a real chance to succeed if it maintains its standards and spends a little more time enriching its base beef and chicken stock. It uses quality ingredients and keeps its facility clean. There isn't much competition nearby, so with effort and good fortune their road is clear ahead.","date":"2021-08-28 23:32:10","vector":[0.0717090909,0.0,0.0,0.0003866667,0.0]}

Perfect means I have to have 0 complaints. So any complaint automatically brings you down to 4 stars.\n\nFor The Dutch, everything we ordered was good, a couple of things blew us away, but room for improvement for sure.\n\nWe started with the smoked beets. You can tell the chef knows food by the presentation and thoughtfulness of the food couplings. Adding nuts and a taziki sauce to beets and fruit make for a great bite. Complaint here was the fruit though. Grapefruit and orange just did not seem to go well with the smoked beet flavor. My buddy agreed with me.\n\nThen came bananas foster donuts. WOAH...these things were amazing! Comes with 3 to an order, the inside is FILLED with a banana sauce and a good strong alcohol flavor to it. Donut is light and sugared on the outside. Amazing appetizer for a brunch. No complaints there.\n\nFor our entrees we did family style, and we ordered the zucchini frittata, crab cakes benedict, double dutch burger, and strawberry shortcake french toast. In order from best to worst was French toast and burger tied for number 1, then crab cakes, then frittata. Frittata did not have barely any real zucchini flavor. The tomatoes in the dish were more a star for me than the zucchini, and while still good, not great. The crab cakes were amazing, but 1 small thing was that my egg was not cooked very well. Came out watery, but other than that the crab cakes were amazing with a great hollandaise!\n\n Both the burger and french toast were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. One of the best burgers I have had in Nashville. Aged cheddar made it perfect with a different flavor, 2 patties, soft bun, cooked well, juicy, I mean I could go on. Incredible, and the fries with it were amazing as well. French toast was cooked perfectly, not doused in all kinds of maple syrup so you got a good natural sweet flavor from the strawberries, and the cream with it was great. \n\nService was great also. Everyone we talked to was nice, and we made a joke about them trying to take our fries to quickly and brought us more out of nowhere.

They have a nice breakfast menu, and a breakfast buffet set up which was a pretty typical spread at a hotel. And at $30 per person, we decided to order off the menu. I had black coffee and my bf had an iced almond milk latte. The drinks were good but I enjoy a large cup of coffee in the mornings and the coffee cup was smaller than I prefer and also $5 for straight black coffee.

Whoever invents an easy way to eat avocado toast will be a genius because there just isn't a non-messy way to do it. But the flavors were very good and I enjoyed the green salad on the side.

Has some extra tang to it in a bad way, something is off. And on top of that, literally the least amount of chicken I've ever gotten from them. 4.83 ounces, absolutely pitiful compared to other neighborhood Indian places, even compared to Kurry Shack 3 or 4 months ago this is just sad. \n\nI weigh and measure everything I eat for dietary reasons and Kurry Shack used to clock in with 6.5 to 8 ounces of chicken in the various curry dishes (Tikka, Korma, etc). I have an order from July clocking in at 7.7 ounces, and June at 6.5 ounces, among others in a similar range. \n\nThis is barely 40 grams of protein.

Simply put, this is the best gelato you're going to find in the city. The prices are slightly more than what you might pay for at an ice cream shop, but then again, this isn't ice cream. It's so much better.\n\nTheir flavors change daily, as well as seasonally. Also, they aren't afraid to experiment, and you shouldn't be either. I remember going in one time and seeing a tub of pinkish gelato with a rose flower in it. Rose flavored gelato? Really? I asked for a sample and was taken aback. Now, I've never been inclined to eat a rose. I've had rose oil- and rose water-flavored foods before, and sure, I *guess* that's what a rose probably tastes like, but I've never been impressed. But this gelato? Somehow Capogiro managed to exactly transfer the delicate scent of a rose into a flavor. It tastes exactly how it smells.\n\nThis is a common practice with every flavor. They take something as simple as chocolate and let you taste parts of chocolate you didn't know existed. Fruits, nuts, spices, liqueurs, and anything else that might potentially taste good in smooth, creamy, frozen dairy form--if it's out there, chances are Capogiro will make or has made it into a gelato flavor at some point.","date":"2011-11-30 19:23:57","vector":[0.0003090909,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

When I got home, I actually had to take some bread and use it to sop up the rest of the sauce- can't have it go to waste (it was that good)!\n\nSweet potatoes - mashed. It was sweet and had a hint of amaretto (I think). It was very flavorful and could be a dessert by itself. My only complain is that it had traces of the roots, so some bites were a bit stringy.\n\nMac and cheese - tough to go wrong with mac and cheese. I thought it tasted good, mainly because it was smothered in curry.\n\nThe sweet potatoes and mac and cheese were an odd combination as sides (and because they were all pretty much mushed together0, but I had hard time hearing the guy in the truck. I kind of just quickly picked the sides. But I have ot admit, they were perfect together! \n\nPrice-wise, I thought it was a bit pricey, but it was definately a lot of food. They actually gave me an option of 3 sides (for the same price), but I didn't take it.

After the second time they would recognize me coming in and have my coffee waiting for me.  This alone was impressive, but flash forward 3 years and I stopped in the other day to find that the woman who works there still remembers my order.  It really doesn't get any better than that when you're looking for a fast caffeine fix.","date":"2011-06-29 02:15:22","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2732,0.0]}

I thought the ice cream was okay, but maybe it was my choice of flavor and toppings.  My younger daughter had cotton candy flavor with bubble gum pieces.  I must say, it was the best cotton candy ice cream we've tasted.  There is no seating if you didn't want to walk around.

Cheese on Speedway evoked indelible childhood memories:  eating my very first piece of pepperoni pizza, sugar-fueled birthday parties with friends, and lots of Ms. Pacman.  Those same awkwardly creepy, soda-drenched, matted fur animatronic characters still performed for the birthday partiers.  Other than transitioning from '60s songs to '90s music, not much had changed in the last thirty years.  I guess it was time for an update, right across the street.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nThe \"sticky\" factor is gone, since the tables, carpet and paint on the walls are brand new.   The well-lit dining area is rectangular with no tube running along the top, which makes it a lot easier to keep track of the kids.  Some new attractions have been added, including an elevated, life-size rocking-horse. Flat screen TVs have replaced Chuck E and the gang.\n\nThe \"meh\" stuff:\n\nThe only tables that seat more than four people are in the reserved area.  Unlike before, our group of 6 had to sit at separate tables.  The games are right next to the tables, so we had to shout to be heard over the clamor.  Chaos reigned on this Saturday afternoon, leaving my nerves jangling.  By the time we left, I had a raging headache...vowing never to return.  (I will.)\n\nI forgot to see if the new location has beer or not.  What the hell was I thinking?  That might have turned this into a four star review.\n\nWithout the nostalgia factor, Chuck E Cheese becomes pretty average for an adult.

For one, they black light stamp us with matching numbers (ours was 459).

Overall we had a wonderful lunch experience and I would recommend going back (and I'm not just saying that because of the discount)","date":"2014-01-10 02:18:04","vector":[0.1013384615,0.0,0.2202,0.056575,0.0]}

I came here the other day with my brother and his wife to see them off before moving away to Knoxville (not that any of that matters) but I at least wanted them to have a good experience. The wait staff, at least our waitress, seemed nice enough I suppose and the food wasn't too bad although my own Cajun pasta (my all time fav there) was kinda on the lukewarm side and it didn't seem to have enough cajun spice like I like. I suppose I could've asked for more, but I didn't think I'd need to.\n\nAt any rate, the staff seemed a bit hectic and short-staffed and I suppose I should give them the benefit of the doubt, but I noticed their relationship with each other (as I often do in people as a psych student) and noticed there's quite a bit of tension and aggravation betwixt the lot of them. It made me feel like I was almost unwelcome there. For an area such as the one this is in, I expected better.\n\nThanks!

Unfortunately for him, we won't be ordering from this location again.  We ordered delivery online a few weeks ago. Our pizza and wings arrive about an hour later, cold. Not lukewarm, downright cold. I should mention, we live 2 miles from the store. Additionally, it was lacking the extra cheese I ordered. I promptly emailed customer service. Kudos for a quick response from corporate offering me 2 coupons for free pizzas. Okay, I was pacified by free pizza. My golden tickets arrive about 7 days later, with perfect timing. It had been a long day, it was late (about 9:00 p.m) and I did not want to cook. Pizza sounded perfect. I called to order this time (a stipulation of the coupon) and was told that they were not delivering tonight. I was given a sob story of how there were only 3 employees and she (the manager) couldn't spare one to bring me my pizza. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I am done. I enjoyed my pizza from a competitor that night, who gladly took my money and delivered my dinner.

I was up at the Tucson Mall and started to feel a little peckish, but the food court fare all looked like something being served in a Planet of the Apes-esque prison cell.  The girlfriend and I decided to venture across the street to the Chipotle, so we could share a burrito the size of a toddler's torso.  Instead, we stumbled upon Extreme PIta, the establishment next door.\n\nAt first, I was dubious.  I mean, the place has the word \"extreme\" in its name, and the only two things that I associated with the term were Mountain Dew and head wounds.  Plus, the signage was decorated in a primary colors, McDonaldland kind of way, which made me kind of woozy.  A brief look at the menu, though, and the girlfriend and I decided to hunker down and get extreme.\n\nI'm glad we did.  Extreme Pita seems to draw from a similar clientele as Subway: health-conscious sandwich lovers who want an alternative to fast food.  Their pitas are whole grain, filled with fresh veggies, and packed with lean protein.  That's where the similarities end, though.\n\nEP has one of the most interesting, diverse, quasi-fast food menus I've seen in some times.  They have pitas like falafel, chicken caesar, spicy thai chicken\/beef, etc.  Each pita has some kind of international twist to it.  \n\nOverall, I was pretty impressed with the taste.  I ordered the Thai Beef, and my girlfriend had the falafel.  Both of us liked that the veggies (broccoli, carrots, onions, peppers) were grilled while we waited.  The sandwiches both tasted fresh and clean.  The beef didn't feel like cafeteria meat, and the falafel (even though I'm pretty sure it was baked) was better than that which I have ordered before in certain middle eastern restaurants.\n\nIf there was a weak aspect to either pita, it was the house condiments.  The \"spicy\" thai sauce was anything but and tasted more like sweet and sour sauce with some added lime juice.  The tzatziki on my gf's falafel pita was fine but was missing a cucumbery kick.  I'm more than willing to overlook sauce quality for fresh, well-prepared, wholesome ingredients, though.  Plus, I ordered a small, plus baked chips and a soda, and was more than satisfied.\n\nFinally, a nutritional note for the health-conscious - every small sandwich on the regular (i.e. non-flatbread) part of the menu was under 400 calories (8 Weight Watchers points) and contained healthy amounts of fiber and protein.  As best as I can remember, my thai beef sandwich was 362 calories, with 9 grams of fiber and 23 grams of protein.  It was also super low on saturated fat.\n\nI got the sense that this is a mom and pop-type, individually owned and operated franchise joint.  The owner was ever-present during our meal and went out of his way to check on us and give us nutritional information.  Apparently the place is part of a Canadian chain that is just starting to make major in-roads in the U.S.  I hope it's successful - I'd take Extreme Pita over Subway pretty much any day.","date":"2009-09-14 21:36:13","vector":[0.038194,0.0,0.0,-0.0836916667,0.0]}

We had a group of 6 people all who had done multiple escape rooms before and we all were thrilled with this room. I loved the attention to detail even just in the waiting room and our hosts outfit, made me feel instantly immersed into the whole experience. The clues were all different and kept all of us busy but not frustrated. The clues flowed together seamlessly and all made sense, to me that's a huge importance in an escape room.The only thing I wish was different was the speakers in the rooms were louder, it was tough to hear the guy talking when we were all excitedly looking for clues. Trying not to brag here but we got through the room with roughly 31 minutes to spare. Our host said we might have set the record but that doesn't mean it was boring or easy. Definitely made the top of my list of favorite escape rooms and we are definitely looking forward to their new rooms in the future.","date":"2019-12-01 06:46:55","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30228,0.0]}

Well to that, it did not disappoint. I've been in a few dive bars in my short time on earth, and this is definitely the most divey of them all. It's literally right across the street from Centennial Park, tucked behind a McDonald's. It's a pretty tiny place with two separate rooms, one with the stage where bands play, and the other has pool tables and a few tables with chairs. Considering the look of this place from the outside (and kinda on the inside), it was fairly clean and didn't smell (which I think a few other people have mentioned).\n\nThe bathroom left a lot to be desired, so you might have to meander on over to the McDonald's if you're picky about that kind of stuff. I wasn't drinking but I did overhear the bartender tell another patron that they do accept credit cards, but there's a $2 service charge of some sort. So, I would say they're definitely cash preferred so you might as well just take out a $20 and let it be.

Just normal people looking to have a good time! \n\nThis little bar did have a few quirks the first being the enormous wooden sign from the Alton Belle Casino.- See we are from St. Louis outside of Alton and can't quite figure out how a sign for a casino that no longer exists ended up in Nashville, no where near the Mississippi. But it was our first sign that this was the bar for us. Secondly, strangely Ab Lincoln hung out for a while. Honestly a guy dressed as Ab Lincoln, make-up and all visited the bar, for no apparent reason. But we got photos with him, and how often do you have that opportunity to get your picture taken with a dead president?","date":"2008-06-07 17:27:58","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0500714286,0.0]}

Granted, it was only 5:30, right after work, but we were there for over an hour and not a single soul walked in after us.\n\nThis place was horrible. Yes, the prices are \"good,\" but for sushi that mediocre, I would rather pay more and hit up a better sushi place.\n\nWe ordered the salmon roll, philly roll, and some nigiri. Everything was passable at best. Their miso soup had no flavor whatsoever, and there were like, 4 small squares of tofu in a pretty big container of soup. The vinegar in the sushi rice overpowered the flavor of the fish, which did not taste fresh at all...it tasted like it was at LEAST a couple days old. The salmon was rubbery, the hamachi (yellowtail) didn't taste right, and the tuna wasn't the bright red I'm accustomed to seeing. The salmon and philly rolls had no balance to them; there was too much rice and not enough fish.\n\nMy favorite part was them asking if we wanted them to make our food fresh. Of course, I said yes...but when it was given to us, it looked like it had been sitting in a grocery case for a few days. \n\nI really hope today was a massive fluke and it's not like this all the time, because if it is...I would really wonder how they manage to stay in business. Granted, the decor was cute and service was great, but how do you mess service up when you're only serving two people?\n\n$30 later, we walked out, and I don't have the urge to come back.

Staff Attentiveness: BF and I walk in the front door. There is one seated table inside, about 4 on the patio. We stand there for... 3 minutes or so without being approached. Finally walk out to the patio and stand there for another minute or so. Finally walk up to the bar and ask: \"Should we seat ourselves?\"\nBartender: \"Yes, someone will be right there.\"\nFive minutes later, a table of 5 sits next to us. Within a minute they have a server. We have yet to have any staff person do anything except look at us when walking by.\nFinally someone comes and tells us that the big table (maybe 10 people?) that was seated before we got there has \"all the menus\" and that they'll bring us one when they're done. Starts to walk away, and then stops, \"Can I get you a drink?\" YEAH THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.\nWe ask for water and coke, and say that we'll order more to drink after we see the menu. Menu and drinks come. We wait 10 minutes before we can order, at which point I ask what red wines they have, and clarify: \"I don't need label names, just TYPES of red wine, Merlot, Cab...\" Waitress says she's not sure, gets the wine menu. I order a glass of wine, BF orders a beer. We order 1 app for first service, and then 1 salad and 1 entree for dinner. \n20 minutes later: we get the app.  And more water. Still no booze.\n10 mintues later (mind you, this is THIRTY [30!!] minutes after we ordered it), booze arrives.\n25 minutes later, entrees arrive.\nThe only thing that happened quickly was getting the check.\n\n2, FOOD\nMenu is very NOLA touristy, mixed with \"Carribean\" flair: po-boys, fried fried fried, jerk ___, etc. NOT vege friendly. Pescatarian (like me!) friendly, but you better be in the mood for fried.\na. fried green tomatoes with prawn ($11)\ntwo small slices tomatoes, overly coated and good only if you peeled half the breading off. 1 giant prawn with no flavor to speak of.\nb. Caeasar salad ($7? $9?): standard lettuce and dressing (surprisingly underdressed, however). Nice touch: grape tomatoes. House made croutons: good flavor, too big for comfort. \nc. Shrimp pasta ($17? something outrageous): TERRIBLE. Clearly cheap frozen shrimp (all 5? 6? of them), terrible sauce. BF couldn't even finish it. And he eats some crap, I tell you what.\n\n\n3. Which brings me to COST.\nStandard NOLA tourist menu, with over exobitant prices.\nCharging me $2 more for my glass of wine than what was listed on the menu? HUGE mistake. That kinda stuff comes out of your tip. \nAnyway: The bill was entirely too high for the quality of the food or the service. If it's going to cost me $60 for dinner for two, it better be edible, and I better have service that doesn't infuriate me.\n\n4. Ambience: the courtyard is AMAZING. Pretty and quiet - you forget you're steps away from Frenchmen St. We happened to be there on one of the first fall nights after the long hot summer. So that was extra good.\n80s music on the speakers: always good.\nSinger\/songwriter\/guitarist who started playing midway though: eh.\n\n\nVerdict: I wouldn't go again. Even if someone else was paying. \n\nI know they're somewhat new, so I hope the service, kitchen timing, and menu\/bill $$ discrepencies get worked out as they continue to operate. \nHowever, time is not going fix that food.

There's a Colombian food truck nearby but don't get confused by that one being there, just wrap around the Colombian food truck and you'll find Chamo Bites facing the Publix supermarket. Highlights for me were the teque\u00f1os which are small Venezuelan style cheese sticks you can have made with regular flour or sweet corn flour. I opted for the regular flour. You can always ask for house sauces to enhance your menu selections. The dough the teque\u00f1os were made with reminded me of Latin empanadas but with an even better texture. They were made with white cheese. The 3 house sauces are: a garlic aioli, a cilantro-garlic aioli and a mayo-ketchup combination they call salsa rosa (\"pink sauce\"). I was surprised their fried arepa was not greasy at all. I got the vegetarian arepa and was pleased with it. Their Toston Zuliano consists of huge plantain slices (which in my case the plantains were ripening so they held a hint of sweet) and stuffed with your choice of ingredients. They do drizzle the plantain \"sandwich\" with the cilantro-garlic aioli and a Latin style bbq-like sauce. The panela con lim\u00f3n drink is supposed to be made with raw cane sugar and lemon juice. It might be too sweet for some palates and\/or perfect for others. I'm glad I tried it at least once. Loved the authenticity of the food and definitely recommend if you're in the area.","date":"2021-12-23 08:51:34","vector":[0.1115615385,0.0,0.0,0.1998,0.0]}

It's not like they're throwing bleach next to your food.  Your stuff is being cooked in a little tiny area, and they scrap from front to back.  I've never had any one else's meal get mixed with mine.  Don't worry.  It's just water or a white wine to deglaze the cooktop to prep for the next patron. \n\nNext, if you have a problem with the frozen stuff and having to make your own sauce, then that's fine, but don't give the restaurant a bad review because your are lazy.  The meat and veggies are kept at proper temps to prevent them from spoiling.  \n\nAlso, no kidding the chef was P.O'ed when 12 people come in right near closing time.  At least you got to see him cook your food... ever watch the movie Waiting?  It's funny how you were afraid to eat your food, even though you witnessed it being prepared.  I'd be afraid if he took it into the back room for a bit, then plated it for you.  \n\nSo now for my review:\n\nI've been here many times, and never had a bad meal.  Why?  Because I put the items I wanted in my bowl, poured as much sauce as I wanted on, to the heat I wanted.  So my bowl was ozzing with sauce, and about as hot as a nuclear blast.  It's a great concept.

If you have a problem figuring out how spicy or hot mild you want, there's an indicator: Closer to the grill, the hotter.  \n\nThis place is always dead when I go in, and people never tip the cook.  Throw a few singles in, you're going be headed through at least 3 times anyways, that's essentially 3 meals, tip the guy!","date":"2011-03-21 19:18:58","vector":[0.0040884615,-0.0900666667,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

For a family place to come to where everyone can get exactly what they want for a reasonable price - this is an excellent choice.  I'm just not a huge fan of the DIY concept in general, so disclaimer... that does cloud my judgement here a bit.   I did like that I could make my dinner as spicy as I want, but I found the veggie choices on the buffet kind of lacking.   Canned baby corns...  meh.    \n\nMy first grader however thought this place rocked.   Not so much for his noodle creation but for the super exciting S'mores dessert.   Yes... it comes to the table with two Hershey bars, a ton of marshmallows and graham crackers, and you cook your own over the little mini grill.   Woo was he excited!  This could easily go very very wrong as we had several flaming marshmallows to deal with, but it was fun, different, and now I know I can get him to eat a big plate of veggies and chicken to get it.   He also liked watching the chefs cooking his meal at the huge round grill.   When kids are around though they should try to do some fun stuff like at a Japanese steakhouse - might help boost those tips. \n\nWe had excellent and attentive service.  Refill requests were handled promptly, questions answered thoughtfully, and no issues with cleanliness or the set up of the raw food on the buffet.   Frozen things were frozen - something I worry about at this kind of place.  \n\nWhat I struggled with was there are SO MANY sauces....   and I guess I just don't like having the onus put on me to figure them out.   How much is too much?   How much of this chili oil labeled with 5 flames will put me over the top?   And so on.  I would rather depend on an experienced chef I guess.   \n\nThe prices were reasonable however, and had we been with the program we would have used the Yelp half off appetizer bonus offer for our potstickers!   Dang it.   I'd come here with a group when I didn't want to worry about making sure we'd ordered shareable dishes that everyone would like - it would work quite well in that fashion.","date":"2018-01-22 00:42:55","vector":[0.0956333333,0.0903,0.0257333333,0.1397833333,0.0]}

I have been craving Ghengis Grill that use to be in the area and was told that Hu Hot was similar; so I thought I would give it a try. \n\nWhen we arrived it looked inviting and we were immediately sat in a very comfortable booth. Our waitress came by, introduced herself, took our drink\/appetizer orders, and explained the lines to us since it was our first time. It was then that the poor experience began. \n\nUpon first look at the food bars, I was slightly disgusted. The meats were all frozen. No, beyond frozen. The chicken, which is what I chose, was very thinly sliced, similar to lunch meat. Looking at other protein options, most were treated the same. Frozen, poor quality, discolored, and freezer burned. They were also becoming mixed into each other as no care was given to tidying up the food bins through the night. \n\nNext were the vegetables. While they all seemed to begin as individual ingredients (which were also frozen), by the time we got there this evening, it looked like the area had been ransacked by toddlers. (I am a toddler teacher, trust me, they're messy.) Vegetables were beginning to be mixed together in the same fashion as the meats. It was not appealing to have to dig through bean sprouts, broccoli, and onions just to get to the pineapple that was from a can. \n\nFinally, the last stop on the line was the sauces. While there are 2 main options (create your own or their prepared recipes), this area was also a slight disaster. Sauces were everywhere. Spilling into others, all over the counters, and covering several of the ladle handles. This all is in addition to the food items that had previously fallen from customers bowls before me and had not been cleaned up by an employee. \n\nOnce we finished assembling our bowls, we headed over to the mongolian style grill where they cook your food. They poured our bowls onto the grill. They then proceded to cook our meals, and the meals of other customers, with the same utensils! This was incomprehensible to us, but we continued on for the yelp community. Once our food was finished and scraped onto our plates, we went to our table. \n\nWhen we started eating, my husband found food from the meal that was being cooked next to his, mixed into his dinner. This, along with the frozen appetizers we had ordered (crab rangoon and pot stickers), the jarred sauces, horrible service, cold\/overcooked rice, and the rediculously high cost for the quality of food, is why Hu Hot is lucky they got 1 star out of me.","date":"2015-07-04 03:42:33","vector":[-0.0445,-0.1204,0.0,0.0776875,0.0]}

For the most part you serve yourself since it is the pick your food and sauce - watch it grill - place.  The sad part was handing my food over to a cook who was obviously angry that we would dare want to eat at 8pm... about 12 customers (we were 2 of them) showed up at 8, causing this cook to stay on later than he had wanted... he was banging on the grill - tossing dishes - and yelling to the other cook about the poor management, his hours, and how angry he was he was stuck here - how ready he was to quit.  Hmm... I don't think I really want you cooking my food then, please leave?!  \nI honestly couldn't trust that my meat was cooked properly when my potatoes were still raw.  That kinda ruins a meal if all I can eat are veggies loaded with sauce and noodles.  We had ordered an appetizer of their \"Krab Rangoon\" which states it is stuffed full of... well, not much crab or cream cheese - and the wonton wrappers were so crispy my mouth is sore from eating them.\nOur server was apparently busy elsewhere as we couldn't find him most of the meal.  No one thanks us as we leave - they are all busy trying to leave themselves.

The yogurt (they also have a non-dairy option) is quite customizable, with various sizes. Toppings are one price for an unlimited helping of most of them, with some premium add-ons. You can go for fruit, nuts, or candy, and as such can get a range of nutritional and gustatory experiences.\n\nI tried a pomegranate yogurt with some fruit, almonds, and chocolate (selecting it over the more caloric hazelnut yogurt in an uncharacteristic display of restraint for me). It was certainly tasty, with a bit of yogurt-y sourness counteracted by the toppings. The biggest negatives for me were that the flavor selection in store was not large (only up to six flavors I think), and this stuff melts very quickly. It was by no means peak Louisiana summer when I dropped in, and I did not go terribly far. Don't get me wrong, it's still tasty in liquid form, but I wouldn't rely on taking it to-go.\n\nAnyway, it's still good.

And the total portion size of the meal is large enough that I always have leftovers to take home for the next day. If you like spicy food, get the red lentil dish or the spicy boneless chicken - absolutely delicious! Also, try the Ethiopian ice tea - it is very tasty and smooth! \n\nI also really like the ambiance of the restaurant. It's just a nice, relaxed atmosphere since it is a smaller sized restaurant and not a chain restaurant. There is plently of seating available but it is arranged nicely. \n\nLastly, the staff there are always very pleasant.\n\nThe other Zeman restaurant on E.

This place is the real deal.  What started out as a good looking photograph in a Groupon solicitation has resulted in a true eastside favorite for us.  We bought the deal knowing nothing about Gramboli's, or even where it was.  It only took the photo of a beautiful slice of true deep-dish pizza to sell us on it. \n\nTo be honest, the place isn't much to look at.  A small dining room, clad in dark wood paneling, and a counter area with a window into the kitchen (where the magic happens).  We ordered what we had seen in the photo, a large deep-dish Gramboli's Special, with sausage, pepperoni, green pepper, mushroom, and substituted banana peppers for the onion.  We also got breadsticks and salads, because we like to eat healthy.  The breadsticks are good--chewy and full of flavor.  The tomato sauce served alongside is rich, thick, and boldly tomatoey, more pizza sauce than marinara.  The salads are a good size, with tomatoes and cukes, croutons and a sprinkle of cheddar.  But enough about that stuff.  Let's get on to...\n\nThe pie.  Holy God.  It was everything the photo promised, and more.  This pizza could stand up to some of the better Chicago joints.  The crust is thick and crisp where it should be.  The toppings are generous, including the cheese.  The sauce returns to show us what it can really do.  A large gets you ten slices, I think, and they're still good sized wedges, and the price is really reasonable considering the amount of food you're getting (and probably taking home).  If you like deep-dish pizza, if this isn't the best you've had in Indy, I'll be surprised.  You'll find it hard to stop eating, I promise.  And you'll still  dream about it later.  \n\nSince we took that chance on an unknown eatery, we have made a habit of returning Gramboli's.  It's worth the drive.  Chances are, you'll be served by an owner, or your pizza will be made by an owner, or both.  Everyone we've encountered has been helpful, super friendly, and extremely efficient, even considering the time it takes to fully bake a deep-dish pizza.  These people take their pizza seriously, and you should too.","date":"2011-07-20 13:24:49","vector":[0.1705648649,0.0,0.0,0.1334444444,0.0]}

The environment is warm and friendly having both TVs and Arcade machines with a friendly staff to boot, but let's get on to the goods...\n\nThis was my first time to Gramboli's Pizza and I opted to try a medium All The Meats. Great choice, because all the ingredients were fresh and the pizza came very well topped! \n\nToppings: \n\n-The pepperoni is good - some places have really shoddy pepperoni but just looking at it you can tell it's not some lower quality pepperoni like some tend to use and cheap out on.\n\n-The sausage and beef was ground well and not overly chunky or too small, which means it was cooked just right -not too much or too little. Not caring for ham, I substituted it with Pepperoni.\n\n-The real shining star here is their Bacon. This place gets it right! Fresh, crispy bacon... not excessively fat or chewy like you end up with at a lot of chains and definitely worth adding if you're a bacon lover!\n\nSauce: very distinctive, tasty sauce. I generally tend to always order a side of pizza sauce to dip my pizza in because most places never put enough sauce on their pizza but that wasn't the case here. Plenty of sauce and just enough sweet flavor to give it that addicting and satisfying taste that will make you want just another slice!\n\nCrust: I opted for the hand-tossed this time but am normally a thin crust type of person. I was surprised by how soft their crust was yet somehow perfect - in the sense that it wasn't gooey or doughy or undercooked like some places... but still soft. Just about right.\n\nDefinitely coming back for more and look forward to exploring their other menu options, including the funnel cake fries for dessert? Sounds awesome. Highly recommended for the Family weekenders! Great Pizza at a decent price and if you don't mind paying just a little more for quality food, this is where you should head to.","date":"2014-11-15 04:20:44","vector":[0.1734142857,0.0,0.0,0.2536333333,0.0]}

So, if you're a thin burger lover, this isn't for you. To finish, I got the ABC milkshake-- AMAZING. You can see my reaction in the photo. Overall, delicious and will be back again.","date":"2018-04-15 17:20:43","vector":[0.184325,0.0,0.0,0.2246333333,0.0]}

The pizza is just OK. It's flat, artisan style, usually a little burnt. Honestly, it's hard to mess up a pizza. I make them at home all the time and these are sure nothing special. The decor here is GREAT! They even have a little nook for outdoor seating on nice weather days. Prices are a little steep for pizza, but hey, its a prime location. The menu is eclectic, weird at times, but you can find something you'll like for sure. \n\nMy problem is the STAFF, especially the shoddy manager that has been there for each of my visits. One visit #1, I was greeted a by a properly dressed, dapper, professional host and treated very well, felt sort of special. Friendly smile, handshake, and a quick trip to the table. That was the LAST time I have been treated properly. The servers are stressed (even though not a full house), distant, robotic and the food is SLOW to arrive.....an 8-minute pizza should not take 40 minutes to be at the table while the place is less than half full. Visits number 2 and 3 are almost identical so I'll lump them together. Again, disinterested service (wait staff) is the problem. The root of the problem seems to be the \"manager\". Gone is the friendly, polite and well dressed dapper host. Instead, the \"manager\" is now also the host. No greeting, no smile, no handshake, he just condescendingly said \"two\"? Wearing dirty wrinkles blue jeans, he lurked his way to our table, tossed down the menus and walked off. No eye contact, no smile, no \"enjoy your meal\". I managed to hurriedly ask what his favorites are on the menu, and he said I should just order whatever I want. What?! Really? That's what I should do? Thanks. Just a weird fellow, and it shows in the overall service of the restaurant. I think they could benefit from a visit from one of those restaurant make-over guys on cable TV. I personally saw him (on visit number two), lift a pizza that was ready to go out to a table with his DIRTY bare hands, apparently inspecting how black the bottom is burnt. Then he yelled at the pizza chef, in a low voice, hands waiving. Call me the weird one, but the guy handling dirty menus, wiping tables, checks and credit cards should NOT be touching my food. Why is a manager in the kitchen, wiping tables and greeting, and running credit cards anyway? I think this is symptomatic of a lack of basic organizational skills. But I'm not a restaurant manager, so I don't know. \n\nLastly, our pizza was made wrong, but caught by our server and he re-entered the order. But mistakes happen, no big deal.\n\nBut hey, I have to be honest. It's really NOT a one star place. It is a two-star. Clean up the dirty, unprofessional, disorganized manager and you could push it to a three-star plus. I suggest you go actually just to watch the demeanor, dress, and cleanliness of the manager. He'll be the WORST dressed employee there. The leader of this ship is a train-wreck, so you can't blame the entire crew. And no, there is no smile, or wave, or \"thank you\" as customers file past the \"manager\" on the way out....and you can go to Hardee's and get at least that basic level of interaction. And you know what, news flash, that makes a customer feel appreciated. IF you go, you won't be in any hurry to go back. For me, I'm DONE.","date":"2013-08-05 13:19:11","vector":[-0.1182714286,0.0946625,0.2545333333,-0.03631875,0.0]}

We ordered the matcha flavored shaved ice, with which you could definitely taste the matcha flavor, and it didn't taste powdery.  The only issue was that there was one tiny scoop of ice cream (and why would it be matcha ice cream?! the ice is already matcha flavored!), and small amounts of q balls and pearls (two thumbs up for how the pearls taste though - the right amount of chewiness and brown sugar taste).  The syrup in which the tofu pudding sits in was good, not overly sweet, and a nice compliment to the tofu.  We felt like there was more toppings with the tofu pudding than the shaved ice, or maybe it just seemed that way because there was less tofu pudding than shaved ice?

Little kids everywhere. I don't mind gaming with teenagers, but there were probably 100 toddlers in this place. There's people with strollers taking their infants. People, please go to Chuck E Cheese.\n\nI guess there's an any-age policy at the whole chain, it's just not what I was expecting. If anything, they should make it adults-only (or at least 13+) on weekdays and maybe open it up to all on weekends. I know that banning kids would cut into their customer base, but this makes older people not want to go, so pick your poison. I thought adults were the target market but that's not even close to the truth.\n\nAs far as the games, I didn't see anything for more than two players. I don't know how arcade games have evolved in the past 20 years, but way back in the day you could play some with four. \n\nThe best I saw was a downhill ski racing game, where you stand on it and steer with your feet. Cold air in your face for added effect. \nThe Walking Dead game was pretty cool. Kind of weird to have a crossbow that you reload instantly with 8 shots at a time. ....but I guess they're not going for realism in a zombie game. It's just a license for marketing, it's a generic zombie game. No show or comic characters. I don't care either way, it's not a bad game.\nThere's a racing game that takes a picture of your face before the race, and is connected to other machines at other locations. My friend and I were in tears laughing at this, since we would pick out a victim at the start of the race and try to ruin their day by running them off the road and making sure they lose. We just picked whoever looked most likely to cry.\n\nThere are plenty of bad games to make up for the good ones, but overall I actually had fun. Not sure if I'll be returning unless I find time to go when school is in session.

I'd love to have actually gone to Nashville, but the airport is not a place I ever need to go again. It's small, clean, easily navigated, and completely blah. I forlornly wandered from one end of the v-chaprd airport, probably going back and forth three times, before I finally decided to suck it up and go to noshville. Obviously I wanted bbq, but the bbq places attached to tootsies did not look good--the meat was weirdly colored, the chicken was oily, most sides and the gravy had a crust; the mashed potatoes, on the other hand, looked like they were made from real potatoes, and looked fresh. But I'd seen matzoh ball soup on the noshville menu and I figured at least it would be small. It actually turned out to be not the worst, a pleasant surprise. The matzoh ball was huge, pretty dense, not as airy as I'd have liked, but not rock hard. the soup was certainly not the best, but it wasn't gelatinous and Campbell's-esque, either, and it actually had some veggies and egg noodles, so it was pretty filling (it's amazing how hard that is to find--I'd expected great things at zingermans in Ann arbor, for instance, and got one small matzoh ball with plain, thin broth). And noshville is across from Starbucks, where I got a decent Arnold Palmer. So Nashville won't be found among the ranks of airports like O'Hare, with anything like frontera grill, but it could have been worse.

After sitting in the Drive-Thru 4 minutes I began asking if there was anyone there. Finally after I was greeted and I explained what I wanted but got no response. I waited for another 5 minutes and pulled up to the window. I was assuming there was a problem with the drive-thru speaker. When I pulled up there were three employees sitting on the counter texting and talking and no one would look over. I sat at the window for 3 minutes and thought I'm going to take a picture of them I bet their general manager would like to see how his restaurant is being run. When I did that they all three ran to the window and said it was illegal for me to take their picture because they were minors and that they were going to call the police on me if I didn't get out of her drive-thru right now. So I asked if they had gotten my order. Then one of the girls left and got into a vehicle that was obviously waiting for her. I took a picture of her so I could distinguish which one was obviously not on the clock. Then the manager Named Destiny came out and took a picture of my license plates threatening that she was calling them into the police. Destiny said she was the only one working and asked if I wanted an application. Then the teenage boy put his fingers on each side of his head like antlers and wiggle his fingers and said nanana. So I left and so did three cars behind me. Crappy way to run a business","date":"2021-02-26 02:49:51","vector":[0.0,0.0903,0.0,-0.1134333333,0.0]}

We walked in with nobody in the lobby. It was filthy, with food and crumbs all over most of the tables. That should have been my first clue. The boy behind the counter stuck his finger up to tell us to wait because he was helping drive through. I used to work at Hardee's and I'm familiar with the way they spread labor, so I didn't say anything. The manager came out of her office and instantly looked annoyed.\n\nThe order was as we asked for it, except they forgot my sauce and one of our cookies for the $5 meals.

We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday to find a few tables occupied but it started to fill up on the restaurant side during our visit.  We were seated in a half booth, half chairs area next the front area.  The layout is quite spacious and I even though there was a large group, I didn't find it was too noisy and we could have our own conversations without overhearing others.  The walls are decorated with a few photos of refineries.\n\nWe asked our server if they had a drink menu as we didn't see one and inquired if they have margaritas and daiquiris but unfortunately they don't have any slushy drinks.  She said maybe in the future they would so fingers crossed for my girlfriends.  The menu was double sided and lots of good variety with pastas, sandwiches, steaks, and more.  \n\nA few of us ordered appetizers; calamari and escargot.  The calamari was nice and crispy and I enjoyed it with drizzled with lemon juice and tzatzki sauce.  My friend liked her escargot.  I didn't think the wait for our food was that long but it was difficult to track as we were chatting.  One of my friends commented the service was a little slow.\n\nWhen our entrees did arrive, they were big portions.  The French Dip had a lot of beef and it was 2 large halves.   The clubhouse sandwich was loaded with roast turkey and a friend commented how she would fit it in her mouth! My chicken pita was the right size and I was able to finish it off without leftovers.  It was a bit messy with the tzatski sauce but very tasty.\n\nThe sandwiches came with a side including soup, fries, mashed potatoes and roast potatoes.  I had the roast potatoes and it was 3 halves that had dill, and lemon flavoured.  I didn't like them as much as my friend's homemade fries which were delicious.  The soup bowl was huge, more like a cereal bowl.  Just about everyone got half their sandwich\/meal to go because it was too much.  My friend commented they serve American sized portions here and I would definitely agree!   The price of our sandwiches were very reasonable in the $13-$16 range.\n\nI will definitely be back again to try something else and enjoy it for 2 meals! They may also open a patio in the future too.","date":"2016-05-10 03:02:24","vector":[0.0395171429,0.1589,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Flash forward more years than I care to count and many Friday nights you will find me there, again. The Bala is a solid neighborhood bar with good food, good music, good people, and good pool. \n\nFriday nights are pretty nice. Happy hour is filled but calm, but by 9-10 pm it's crowded and the DJ is usually killing old school rap (a week or two ago I heard MC Lyte's I'm Not Havin' It for the first time in maybe 20 years! And, i am proud to say, I discovered i *still* know every word!).\n\nDrinks are cheap, bartenders are fast and nice.

All are in good condition, almost always at least half in use, and always full of people who are good game. (Even when it's crowded it is possible to get a table for you and a date to mess around on, though...)\n\nKitchen: inexpensive and darn good food.

Looks pretty divey from the outside, not that that is always a bad thing, after all, I said I was looking for cheap drinks.  Place was pretty busy on a Thurs nite, with most of the patrons gathered around the several pool tables in the back.  I'm a pretty crappy pool player so I was too intimidated to go and try to get into the mix with all the players so we opted to sit and the bar and feed the Megatouch (3 games for a buck).  The interior is pretty no-frills but not not terrible.  The beers were definitely not cheap: 2 Victory and 2 Yuengling were almost $18 bucks.  Service was kind of on the lackluster side but not unfriendly.  At one point one of the employees told my girl to \"put her purse on her lap\" (it was hanging on the bar chair she was seated at, but clearly under her control and supervision) \"because someone will walk out with it\".  Really, it's like that in here?  I'm sure he said this to be nice but I don't generally think it's a great idea to tell a woman how to look after her purse.  As she said, \"do I tell guys where to put there wallets?\"  Point taken little lady.  Anyway, it didn't exactly contribute to a relaxed night out.  We probably won't be back, except possibly during the day if it is empty enough to shoot some pool.  Just a little too expensive for the slightly shady\/divey factor.

When I walked in, I was greeted by Nick himself who immediately began dishing out samples of his many water ice flavors.  What a treat!  My boyfriend and I stood there trying sample cups of all different flavors (from mango to watermelon to cherry to tangerine to lime to... chocolate!  As a person who does not typically like the flavor of chocolate ice, I was very skeptical.  However, this chocolate was rich and creamy and delicious... so much so that I almost ordered it!).  After trying all of these fabulous flavors, I was having the most difficult time deciding.  That is when Nick offered to make me his Lifesaver combination - a beautiful rainbow of cherry, tangerine, mango, lemon, lime, and blueberry.  He sculpted the flavors in the cup perfectly so that I could taste and see each flavor individually.  Mmmmm - it was the most delicious combination!\n\nNick the owner is passionate about what he does and will not disappoint.

Five fifty and the hatred of the rest of the customers was the price I gladly paid to score the last twelve inch sandwich they had (apparently he smokes two shoulders a day behind the building), and it was more than worth it. Tender and juicy, drenched in sauce, and loaded thick onto a foot long steak roll, for under $6...... it's like he designed it especially for me. I opted for no cheese or slaw, but that is just my way of eating it.

The line up in downtown for a new restaurant was as expected, extremely long and unrealistic to get in at a decent time, instead my girlfriend and I decided to go there for dinner.  I was absolutely not disappointed!\n\nShe got the California Classic and I got the Babel, which is a burger off of their Secret menu from their website (Definitely some interesting combinations on there!), regular fries and a mint chocolate chip milkshake to share.  \n\nThe lineup was moving at a pretty decent pace and it did not take long for our food to arrive in comparison with how busy it was (waited less than 10 minutes for our food); the girl taking my order seemed quite patient in answering a few questions I had (for all the viewing of the menu I still seemed indecisive what I wanted to try first).  One thing of note here that I was quite impressed with was one lady had been waiting for what must have been a long time.  One of the cooks recognized this and realized they had accidentally skipped her order and immediately offered her entire order on the house and their apologies.  This made me immediately like their customer service by recognizing an issue before a customer and making it right, especially when the customer even said that it was ok and that they will still pay and the burger priest cook still insisted she not pay.\n\nAs for the California Classic, my girlfriend liked it quite a bit, and while I did not take a full on bite of it, I still enjoyed the \"secret\" sauce they put in it.\n\n The babel is basically 3 patties (2 beef and 1 \"vegetarian\" patty that's deepfried) wedged between TWO grilled cheese sandwiches. It was not as big as I anticipated it to be (it was more squished together), though looking at the photos of the website it wasn't exactly  a size that would even fit in your mouth.  This however was in no way a turnoff and still looked deliciously messy!  The burger itself was quite juicy and cooked to a medium well (what most places seem to cook here), though I personally would have preferred it cooked to a medium with how fresh the meat looked (very bright in colour).  The first to the last bites were definitely consistent in taste and juiciness. Some people who are not huge fans of cheese may find this burger to contain too much cheese, but someone who loves cheese, like myself, will adore this burger.\n\nThe mint chocolate Milkshake was really good, however I was a bit disappointed to start drinking it only to find out that I could have upgraded to \"real malt\", this is something I would have definitely done and would have been nice if it was upsold from the beginning, though I can not confirm if this was even an option for the shake I got- regardless it was still tasteful and was not over bearing in mint like most places, I felt it was well-balanced.  Definitely will want to try something else next time, but would come back to this shake again.\n\nThe fries were just plain, nothing else on them, they were not the crispiest things out there but they were not terrible even though slightly greasy.  I would definitely say that if you're going with one of the larger burgers to skip this as I felt the plain fries were uneventful, though I imagine one of their chili fries\/other options may go well with these style of fries.  It would be nice if they also \"redeemed the fries\", I would say other comparable burger joints have slightly better fries, but burgers and fries definitely go hand in hand and would wish this to improve the next time I go there. Edit:  Other Yelpers are mentioning the \"small bits\" of fries, this was another thing noticed - the fries were extremely short.  It would be nice if they freshly cut potatoes in the back for their fries... That would definitely make this place over the top.\n\nIn the end I would highly recommend any burger fanatic to definitely try this place!","date":"2015-03-19 03:14:46","vector":[0.1410378378,0.1405,0.0,0.1409363636,0.0]}

As you can imagine, week after week of hotels gets expensive- and boring. I did a little research and found Gram's Place. What a find! It's not your average...well, anything! Its an eclectic somewhat \"hippy-style\" lodging where you will not be lonely or bored. Its been described as \"a cross between Key West and Amsterdam\". \n\nI stayed in two different rooms, what are now called the \"Blues Room\" and in the \"Adventure Room.\"  The Blues Room was located in the main house and has a really old kitchen that they call the \"I Love Lucy\" kitchen. The Adventure Room was basically a shed with bunks. Both were totally adequate- comfortable bed with clean linens and facilities. You can certainly rest your head here. Breakfast was \"fix it yourself\" at the time, now you can bring your own cereal or head out and grab. \n\nThe Jacuzzi was very nice and welcome after a long day at work. Best of all though, was the free and easy atmosphere and the music that fellow guests played. It was like staying with a friend. \n\nIf you are open-minded, not in need of much amenities and would like to feel more \"at home\" than \"on the road\" check it out!","date":"2009-01-22 20:57:58","vector":[0.0,0.34,0.0,0.192925,0.0]}

Also two more words: Not fresh. \nI ordered the special A1 peppercorn burger on an \"onion ciabatta bun\" with a special sauce and fried onion strips. Now since most of what they do is burgers, and they sure charge enough for them (over ten bucks), one would hope they could get it right, or at least sort of. At about four times the price of a Sonic burger it should be at least twice the quality, but sadly, no.  The \"onion ciabbatta\" was stale and tasteless with a few dark flecks of something on it that may have been onion. Or maybe just dirt. Anyway the bun was about as tasty as a folded up paper towel. The special pepper sauce had plenty of stale pepper but no other flavor. The bacon strips on it were okay, but the cheese was skimpy and along with a bit of tomato and lettuce added nothing. The deep fried onion strings were mushy and greased, too salty and had unchewable outer peels in it that should have been tossed out before cooking. The hamburger meat was greasy, but dry and had no juice in it, which means it was either cooked from frozen, and\/or the cook stupidly squeezed the juices out of it on the grill. It was overcooked for what I had ordered and did not have a good taste. All of this was squished together into a greasy mess. I enjoy hamburgers, but halfway through it this thing was making me gag and I just couldn't finish it. As a side, I chose the sweet potato fries. They were tasteless, obviously from frozen, mushy and greasy. It seems there are things on the menu like salads that may not be as greased, so the place might be okay to have a drink or two and a side snack of salad or soup.

Reading the other reviews, I thought this would be a good place to get some dinner but I thought wrong. The pho here isn't that great.  It still puzzles me how others think it's the best pho. Out of all the pho places I've tried, this is probably on the bottom list. There was nothing great about it.  I usually order the spring rolls and pho noodle soup. The spring rolls didn't stand out nor did the peanut sauce (and the sauce is always the best part!) The broth for the soup was ok- nothing outstanding about it either. The food was OK. That's pretty much it.  \n\nThe price for the amount of food I got was a little expensive for my taste. Two spring rolls and a small soup = $13.10. I've been to other pho places that were less costly with larger food proportions. It's sort of a rip off. \n\nThe location isn't the best. It shares the same dining area with Port of Subs. Personally, I could care less for location. As long as the food is great, it doesn't matter. The best foods usually come from little hole-in-the-wall places. For this place, it isn't the case. \n\nIf you're hungry and looking for a place to eat, it's an ok place- but not the greatest. If you're eating out to experience great food or a special occasion, I wouldn't really recommend this place.\n\nIt is not the best pho in Reno. If it is, that's pretty sad.\n\nSorry, I can only give it 2 stars.","date":"2009-08-13 01:00:14","vector":[0.1488933333,0.0,0.0,0.074,0.0]}

So tight that it seemed like they might do an assembly line pre-roll prep or they wanted me to really work to get them unwrapped.  If this were a to-go order this would have made sense to me, but they were brought on a tray with the cup of peanut sauce.  Not a wonderfully appetizing presentation.

Besides irony, they add other things I like- caramelized onions, goat cheese, and bacon. I was hesitant to see how a sandwich place would handle the making of a crepe, but this had a great roti-like texture. The lamb neck edges had crunchy grilled texture- like what you might find on a short-rib. My one complaint was that there were a few inedible fat\/cartilage (or whatever you find in necks) pieces that were made harder to pick out because of the crepe format.\n\nPork Schnitzel ($12) with arugula, fried egg, and a cherry mustarda was a heartier choice. The breaded pork loin was pounded to a uniform width and greaseless.  The sweet, spicy mustarda made things more interesting and the seeded roll help up to the rest of the ingredients.","date":"2015-08-30 14:48:12","vector":[0.1509888889,0.0,0.0,0.09534,0.0]}

She loved to tell stories, and she was very attentive to everyone's questions and interests. \n\nQuick note: you shouldn't be starving before the tour. I'd eat a small brunch beforehand. We got a small portion of every food. We weren't hungry after the tour, but it definitely wasn't a feast!\n\n- Antoine's - the tour naturally began with the oldest restaurant in New Orleans, and the 2nd oldest restaurant in the country (the 1st being in Boston). We sampled seafood gumbo, which was very tasty. Renee explained the history of New Orleans food culture and all the different influences. At every following stop, she stopped to explain what we were eating and told great stories. \n\n- Leah's Pralines - we all got our own praline to take home. \n\n- Arnaud's - loved the shrimp remoulade. I even bought the sauce to take home and serve with shrimp. It was delicious! You would swear there was horseradish, but there wasn't any in it. We loved going upstairs to see the museum of Mardi Gras dresses. \n\n- Desire's - We got to sample turtle soup served with a bit of sherry. Yum. \n\n- La Divina Cafe e Gelateria's - in line with the Italian presence in NOLA, we got to try the muffaletta panini (great if you like olive salad and great Italian meats) and gelato (we got to try vanilla and satsuma). \n\n- Creole Delicacies Gourmet Shop's - we loved trying the red beans and rice and learning why it's supposed to be served on Monday!\n\n- Tujague's beef brisket and classic Sazerac cocktail - very good.

(My only suggestion would be that she needs to project her voice a little bit more.) \n\nWe visited some FANTASTIC restaurants and shops and everything we tried tasted divine, not to mention that we received big portions of each. The food was plentiful enough to be our lunch...and dessert! I also loved the variety of foods that were offered. We tried a little bit of New Orleans with every bite. There was gumbo, shrimp remoulade, red beans and rice, boiled beef, muffuletta, gelato, pecan pralines, rum cake, and much, much more that my stomach can't recall right now! \n\nHands down, I would recommend this tour over any other attraction or tour in New Orleans. It's a must!","date":"2009-10-19 16:25:38","vector":[0.03716,0.0,0.0,0.156225,0.0]}

Afterward, we were given a tour of the restaurant and a backstage pass to the kitchen.  We actually met the Chef and he answered some of my questions.  How cool was that?\n\nWe also tried pralines from Leah's Pralines.  They were so good, that I shipped some to my dad.\n\nTujague's was an interesting place.  They have some seating in the back, and a small little bar in the front.  We tried our dishes standing, huddled around each other.\n\nWe tried some New Orleans rum cake at Pirate's Alley Cafe (located of off Pirate's Alley).

I'm sure other things on the menu are good, but I'll never find out.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this two stars and not one is because the server was really nice and professional. The food was at our table fast and she did a good job checking on us to see if we needed anything. She was tipped very well and if I knew her name, I would name drop and give her kudos for her hard work.\n\nMy opinion, go to Cheesecake Factory for the cheesecake only and get it to go! If you like waiting, loud conversation, food that you could probably get better at Applebee's and bumping into people, go for it. Don't believe the hype!!

This is the first time I've ever written anything on Yelp but I am just so disgusted with what this place has become I had to let ya'll know. \n\nMy friend from high school just moved back to town so we go to our old favorite spot to catch up. We've been going to Fido for 12 years. We have spent so many nights in there drinking black coffee and indulging on PC muffins, playing cards and talking with friends and strangers for hours. We would roll in hungover for breakfast and sweet potato fries and never have to wait for a table. The people who worked there were friendly. Strangers would share the long tables and leave friends. This has all changed and evolved into the pretentious, superficially trendy reality that Nashville has become. Tonight, we wait in a line stretched back to the bathrooms. A grilled ham and cheese is $10. A salmon bagel is $10. We laugh at how ridiculous it has become but just decide to do it for old time's sake. We are given a location tracker device to take to our table so they can find us with our food. OK.... My friend and I are catching up and getting super hungry. We both have worked in the service industry and are not ones to get riled up or impatient but our food is taking forever. 45 minutes later the guy who rings us up comes over to our table to tell my friend they are out of smoked salmon for our bagel. I was like you have got to be kidding me. He asks her what she wants instead without bringing her a menu. His attitude is completely unapologetic and like we are somehow inconveniencing him. After she asks for a menu and looks it over, obviously flustered as this was completely unexpected and 45 minutes too late, she just says to bring her the same bagel with no salmon on it. Not a choice I would have made but ok. I speak up and say that she should also get some of her money back because there is no way a person should have to pay $10 for a bagel with cream cheese, lettuce, and onion on it because the restaurant ran out of smoked salmon. Really, she should just be refunded because we have waited so long for our food and he is just coming over to tell us they don't have what she ordered. I am informed that is now how this works and that I should always expect to have to wait this long for my food because of the long lines and high volume of people at this restaurant. \n\nThis was just too much for me. I was born and raised in Nashville, I've been coming to this place for over a decade, and some guy in a fedora and a bad attitude I've never seen before in my life is going to tell me what to expect coming to Fido. And is going to tell me that getting a refund on a bagel that is $10 because of the smoked salmon on it isn't possible because that's not how that works. Please, get over yourself. I can think of 30 places in Nashville better to eat than Fido, one of which is right next door: Jackson's. I am just appalled at how rude this guy was, how long it took to get a grilled cheese and bagel sandwich, and how it took 45 minutes to let us know they were out of salmon with no apology offered and a refund straight up refused. I will most certainly never support the joke of a place Fido has turned in to again and will say RIP to the Fido us Nashvillians knew and loved for years.  \n\nPlease don't come to Nashville and waste your time waiting and paying to eat at Fido. And please stop gentrifying our beloved city.","date":"2016-05-19 04:26:13","vector":[-0.0170942857,0.3057,-0.0386,0.0781125,0.0]}

Even then, watch out for server Samantha.  Never have I come across so rude an individual purporting to be a professional.  A customer sat down at the sushi bar, his phone rang, he answered and unless one was totally deaf, you could he was handling a crisis at his job.  Samantha proceeded to mock and berate him with another customer as he tried to speak into his phone.  He finally rose and spoke with management.  (Ms. Harley, the F&B manager on duty promised to \"talk\" to the servers.  Who knows that good this does.)\n\nAs for the food, which would normally be the saving grace, while it was very good, why run a gauntlet of rude service when other commendable sushi is nearby?\n\nStill, the comestibles are worth mentioning.  This an AYCE venue - All You Can Eat - and the Sunday lunch cost $24.95, before tax.  All items tasted were fresh and clean-tasting, with clear, flavorful seafood notes.  Ikura - salmon eggs - were briny and crystal-red, though the kitchen was out of quail egg topper.  A first-time and perhaps unique offering is the Black Pepper-crusted Ahi, virtually the same as fish carpaccio.  It was dense, moist with a very pronounced peppery jolt, but not overbearing.  Salmon and Tuna Nigiri were nice laid out, with the latter sporting tiny lemon rinds, which made for a very refreshing taste.  While the Rainbow roll was very good, the Moyako was the most sensational tasting sushi I have had in years:  Tempura Shrimp and Tuna, laden with and avocado dome.  Masterful!\n\nThe sushi makers themselves are solicitous and thus a much better bet for good service than the floor staff, which needs retraining.","date":"2017-02-13 00:00:10","vector":[0.104745,0.0516,0.1591,0.0,0.0]}

Well, this time it was... very nearly.  The only hiccups may be excused due to both language misunderstandings as well as the absence of a sushi mainstay on the written menu.\n\nI had told a manager about my last two forays into the land of Reno AYCE Sushi, and how an employee at the sushi bar reveled in talking, out loud, about his personal problems and how he hated his job at Kanpai.  This manager was all too well familiar with this scenario and said she would sit me with the best staffer, a genial man named Rene.  The experience was surely uplifting and the food just as wonderful as ever.  The big difference this time around:  Great Service.\n\nFirst glitch was due to a slight language barrier.  I asked for Ikura, Salmon Roe\/eggs, with a Quail Egg Topper.  Was told there were no more quail eggs, which was fine.  However, I received Masago, the much smaller version, known as Flying Fish Roe.  Fresh and briny, but not Ikura.  \n\nThe Unagi, cooked Eel with a sweet-and-savory sauce was a winner, while the black pepper-crusted Ahi was unctuous and well-thought out.  Another small misfire occurred when I ordered the Salmon Skin long roll and got the hand roll instead.  Funny thing, it was the best hand roll I'd ever had, with not only great fillings but also a sturdy wrapper which prevented it from falling apart at first bite.  A winner!\n\nFrom the specialty rolls, I sampled Mountain & Mama's, two divergent tastes, but with all the freshness I have come to expect at Kanpai.  The knockout of the day, however, was the Basil Salmon roll.  Now, if you did not grow up eating Italian and other Mediterranean food, than basil may not be your thing.  The herby flavor came through more than subtle, but did not overpower all the other flavor and textures.  A real treat.\n\nThis visit is what the eating out experience should be.  And except for the very loud and overly-gregarious patron next to me, yelling for \"Oysters on the half shell!\", this visit was a winner par excellence.","date":"2017-08-29 19:44:34","vector":[0.134573913,0.0,0.0,0.164125,0.0]}

The menu is fairly simple. They have cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza, but they also have this garlic \"mootz\" pizza. I've never heard of it, but I ordered one slice of that and the Freddie pizza. It was a square pizza with just sauce on top and sesame seeds on the bottom. I think the cheese was baked into the crust or something. Both pizza were amazing! I loved the mootz pizza because I love garlic. As for the Freddie pizza, who knew that I've been missing sesame seeds in my pizza crust this entire time! \n\nThe trip thing about this place is that the pizza is way too high.

A newcomer to the game is Pauli's Gee's Crescent City Slice Shop. A colleague told me about this new place, which boasted both New York and Chicago style slices. Since I was short on time, I ducked in and quickly scanned their offerings. I was pleasantly surprised to see no fewer than 6 different pizzas on display, all available by the slice. Plus, there were both meat, vegetarian , and vegan options. The crusts varied from thin to thick. All of them looked good in the glass display! I spoke with Marie about the options and I settled on two slices: Freddy Pepperoni Square Slice (thick crust)  and a Sausage Slice (very thin crust). I enjoyed the crunch of the thick crust, as well as the rich flavor of the tomato sauce. Interestingly, the cheese on the thick crust was in the middle of the crust. Honestly, this new style of cheese placement was not my favorite because I didn't get the sense of the cheese - it seemed to be too melded with the dough maybe...? As for the thin slice, the sausage was a bit dried out, the sauce was almost non-existent, and the crust was undercooked. I'm guessing I just happened to get a slice that came out of the oven prematurely. My recommendation is slightly more sauce for sure so that there is a good flavor profile for the thin slices. The restaurant was clean and had ample seating. Once more marketing is done and people get to know this new pizza joint, they'll likely find success through customer feedback and great recommendations.","date":"2021-07-25 19:26:06","vector":[0.1025,0.0,0.0,0.0734,0.0]}

The vegetable noodle soup was very flavourful and was great start to the meal. Reading older reviews a salad was previously also included but times change I guess. \n\nOur group of 3 each ordered different combos (rice & beef safari, pasta carysan with camel and Alfredo pasta with BBQ chicken) and were pleasantly surprised on the speed of service, quality and amount of food we received. Everything arrived quickly  and at once. Missing however was the vegetable of the day, instead the first main dish contained a bit of frozen veggies as garnish.. . \n\nEvery dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked. There is however a $5 extra charge for camel meat but it was beautifully cooked & melt in your mouth tender. \n\nDespite the cutbacks and various changes I still highly recommend trying this place.

Both mornings the same employee made the coffees with incredible efficiency and care (she's featured on the website too!).  They were dark and intense and lacking all of the silly pretension of so many popular coffee joints.  Combined with an egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and you have yourself an incredibly restorative pair after a late night out.\n- The pastry.

Espinoza's is a food truck that typically parks (to my knowledge) on the corner of West and 2nd (downtown), Wednesday-Saturday around 6ish to about 10pm. Occasionally, they don't arrive until about 7:30pm, but it is worth the wait! After about 10 on these days, one may find the truck parked at St. James Infirmary. \n\nI usually get a few carne asada or birria (stewed beef) tacos, along with a carne asada or birria quesadilla. The tacos are only $1.50 each. The quesadilla is $6, and comes with a hefty portion of meat and cheese. Every order comes with homemade hot salsa, which has the perfect kick. They also have a cilantro-avocado salsa that is delicious on the quesadilla. Espinoza's also serves tortas and burritos.\n\nMy friends and I are regulars at this truck - we go at least 1-2 times per week. Whenever we have a hankering to go out for some grub, Espinoza's is our go-to spot, because the food is so satisfying and affordable. The owners of the truck, Maria and Raphael, are friendly and kind people as well. I will continue to bring myself and friends to eat at Espinoza's. :)","date":"2016-06-02 19:45:51","vector":[0.0777866667,0.1589,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I decided to get the suadero burrito, and for $7.00 you will definitely get your money's worth. This burrito was hefty. Filled with lots of meat, rice, and beans, this burrito will definitely fill you up. The suadero was cooked to perfection and was extremely flavorful throughout. I especially loved the texture of the meat. Some parts were crispy, while others were fatty and melted in my mouth. I also tried a bit of the quesadilla, and let me tell you, this is no ordinary quesadilla. It was greasy from the fresh cheese and on top of that, you can get the meat of your choice. \n\nThe service and people inside the food truck were great! Although English did not seem like their first language, they understood my order and were quick to making the food. My only comment about the service is that the people inside need to speak up a little bit when calling out numbers\/orders. I was there when there were only a few people left, so it wasn't much of a problem, but I could see it becoming a concern when people cannot hear their orders. Other than that, the service was top notch! \n\nThe atmosphere of the food and the food truck can be a little hard to describe, but I think the best way to describe it would be family-oriented\/home-y. The employees have a sense of family and it really shows in the food. They seem to love what they're doing and they want others to experience that and their food. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Espinoza's!

To me, they are all the same.  The only reason I say Goten is a bit better is because of the location--they moved into a new place (it's been a while now) right off of West End Avenue, and it's now connected to the new Hotel Indigo.  So, as hotel restaurants go, it's pretty good!\n\nService is just OK.  The hostesses always seem bored (and maybe they are) but the \"chefs\" are decent and as entertaining as you want them to be.  For example, I went with a friend and her kids, and of course the chef really put on a show for the kids and they loved it!  But, when I went with two girlfriends, he realized that we were not there to be entertained, just to eat, so he kept it pretty low-key.  That is nice.  \n\nFood is good--I generally get steak and chicken, and the meal comes with a good bit--salad, soup, rice, veggies, and dessert.  If you are a local and have company in town, this is a good place to go because they can accommodate larger groups.  If you are from out of town, I suggest going somewhere more \"Nashville\", unless you are just really jonesin' for some hibachi-style food.  \n\nOverall, I like Goten, but it could be in Anywhere, USA.","date":"2008-05-05 19:06:06","vector":[0.08808,-0.1366,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

There were 1 person eating and no one at the counter.  I walked over to the buffet line and did not see any Naan bread, which made me want to duck out asap.  Then a lady came out of the back and seated my wife, our 3 year old, and I, towards the window in the back.\n\nThen it was uphill from there!  Naan was freshly made to order, it was so soft and tasty I had to eat like 3 orders!  I tried the lamb curry, chicken curry, and the 8 veggie curry, all were absolutely delicious!  4.5 Star for the food! (Would have been 5 if there were a lil more meat in the curry, but hey what do you expect for $8)\n\nService is what brought this restaurant down IMO.  I had to hunt down the waitress\/cashier\/buslady to order additional Naan.  When she came by to refill the water, she spilled some onto the table and didn't apologize nor try to clean up.  She just walked away like it didnt happen!  Then I noticed she was showing this other couple with their son around the restaurant, striking up a conversation with them...  Must been friends or family visiting or something.\n\nFinally, as we were leaving and paying at the door.  The total bill came out to $18 something and I handed her a $20.  After she puts it in the register, she didn't give me any change and just looked at me like why Im still there.  I told her I left the tips on the table and she just rolled her eyes, handed me the change, and walked away.\n\nOverall, good food, great value, just don't expect much on the service side.","date":"2013-05-15 16:01:07","vector":[0.0777727273,0.4767,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We went 2 weeks ago at roughly 12:30 on a Saturday and there was just sauce, even the vegetable dishes were missing sustenance. We were one of 3 couples in the whole joint and they had only been open since 11:30 so it wasn't like they were feeding a tour bus from Cali or anything like that. There seemed to be no plan to refill any of the dishes either, seeing as we waited for nearly 35 minutes after getting out first plate of sauce and crunchy rice and no more food was brought out. We went back after our first disappointing time hoping it was a fluke but sadly it was the same story different day, little to no meat and thinned out veggi dishes. I have also been put off by the over all attitudes of the waitresses, they never ask you what kind of naan you want and you are very lucky to get any kind of refills so drink sparingly!\n When the food was plentiful at this buffet the quality was lovely, well spiced and tasty but since their first few months of glory they have gone in a weird direction with their whole \"NO FOOD FOR YOU\" approach. Oddly enough even though you leave hungry and sad you still pay full price for an empty buffet, go figure. I was hoping for this place to continue to be on my regular rotation of local eateries but I have had to cross it off my list, the last 2 times eating nothing and paying for it kind of snapped me back into reality from Hope-land and I wont be back for a 3rd attempt.","date":"2013-08-20 19:47:14","vector":[-0.081425,0.0,0.0,-0.1267333333,0.3612]}

That's definitely worse. \n\nOh, and I remember when I had my foot amputated. That was way worse. \n\nThat said, there are few dining experiences as aggravating and sensory-jarring as dining in a Long John Silver's restaurant and this particular location in Castleton on Indy's Northside is one of the better locations in Central Indiana. \n\nNow then, it may seem weird to even review a fast food joint but there are those certain experiences that just call out for a review. \n\nWhat's the Long John Silver's experience like? If you were to combine the unapologetic sterility of McDonald's with the soul-crushing ambience of a Burger King and toss in a pinch of middle school cafeteria warehousing, then you'd have an idea what it's like to dine in a restaurant where you're subjected to the almost constant ringing of a dinging bell that signifies another drive-thru customer and a floor that is almost always bathing in those little crunchy pieces of batter that you love but that make you look like a six-month old still trying to figure out the whole hand-to-mouth motion. \n\nHere's the sad thing. I actually kind of like Long John Silver's. It's kind of like the Wal-Mart of restaurants, because you leave saying \"never again\" but eventually you get the craving and find yourself back in there smooshed together with other diners while your kids wear their silly little pirate hats. I almost always order the two-piece chicken plank combo that comes with a side and a drink. I almost always upsize the drink. It's a cheap meal that tastes cheap, but the truth is I like the chicken, love the hush puppies, and am even a fan of the iced tea. \n\nThe crew at the Castleton location is pretty solid and almost always outgoing and friendly, but there's simply no mistaking this to be a remarkably unpleasant atmosphere and almost stunningly unfriendly to wheelchairs. \n\nWhile they do have a couple wheelchair parking spots, their ramp could use a little work (I've actually fallen on it) and there's a modest incline to get into the restaurant. The restaurant itself really only has one truly accessible table and you'll know it because they clearly identify it that way. It also happens to block the aisle should you have a large wheelchair. I tend, on the other hand, to sit at a back booth that allows me prop my legs up and stay out of everyone's way. Unfortunately, as happened today, this can lead to you getting blocked in with no way to exit the restaurant. \n\nCan you say fire hazard?\n\nThe really strange thing is that this design is after the big Long John Silver's renovation. Um, really. You couldn't have consulted someone on ADA law with your nationwide renovation?\n\nOn the plus side, the bathrooms are now fairly wheelchair friendly as before you simply couldn't get into them at all. \n\nBy the time I leave Long John Silver's, my nerves are shot. The constant dinging is a major irritant and talking employees increase that sense of non-stop noise. On this particular day, it was worsened by a noisier than usual crowd and an overwhelming desire to abandon ship.","date":"2014-11-11 18:35:04","vector":[0.2878,0.3182,0.0,-0.0970222222,0.0]}

By the way, there were only five occupied tables in the place, and three waitresses. I watched our waitress stand around and gossip for a while before she put our order in. Fifteen minutes later, my friend asks for her food not to come out, after all - at this point, we'd been in the restaurant for an hour and forty-five minutes. In the meantime, I begged for some hummus, because I had been hungry when I walked in. \n\nAnother fifteen minutes goes by (TWO HOURS at this point) and the food comes out. The waitress puts the food down in front of my friend, explaining that the chef \"already had cooked it.\" My friend again asks that she not be served, didn't touch it, and the waitress boxed it up for her. \n\nLet's talk about the entrees. My friend was charged $16 for a plate of sauteed frozen vegetables, aka, the \"vegetable tagine.\" The waitress recommended it, which is why she ordered it. Tagine, my butt. He opened a pack of frozen veggies, heated them up, and dumped some spices on it. This was a $5 dish. I ordered the beef neck tagine, which to be fair, was well-spiced. It came with *NOTHING.* It was a tiny piece of meat - once I scraped it all off the bone, it may have filled 1\/5th of a half of a po'boy bun. No couscous, no bread, no nothing. Just some meat scraps in a watery sauce. I had to beg for some sort of grain to go with it - at that point I was starving and we were going on 2 hours and fifteen minutes. \n\nWe were charged for everything, including the food my friend asked she not be served after waiting an hour and forty-five minutes. $65 for two entrees, one appetizer, and no drinks, in a fluorescent-lit place with paper tablecloths? Really? When my friend pointed out that she asked not to be served her frozen veggies and was charged anyway, the waitress argued with her and attempted to refuse to take it off the bill. Not a single thing had been comped, despite our polite, \"it's ok, sometimes things just happen,\" and patient waiting for our food FOR TWO HOURS. We asked for the manager, and got the owner. He had nothing to say, other than \"I don't know what to tell you.\" There was no, \"I'm so sorry, let me bring you something to make up for your bad experience.\" He just seemed like a scolded child. If someone has a genuinely awful experience, shouldn't you at least try to make it up, at least somewhat? No tiny bite of dessert or a nice rose water tea, after basically scamming us? \n\nNo restaurants ever work out in this location, and I've always wondered why. Well, I'm certainly not curious why this place was deserted. \n\nHIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. If you want to be ripped off, go here!","date":"2011-01-22 05:02:31","vector":[-0.0421472222,0.0,0.0,0.0617375,0.0]}

The assistant who will be head coach even gets suspended for 6 games and you got a good Middle Line Backer Jonathan Vilma who is going to be out all year as well.

The Yelp reviews were pretty positive, so I figured we'd give it a go. Most of the reviewers are correct. This food is FANTASTIC and made with high quality ingredients.\n\nGiven that we were going the Sunday before Memorial Day, I called ahead to make sure they had some availability. The hostess told me we'd have a table for 1pm, and we arrived a little early. Another couple also had a table for 2 for 1pm, but due to a clerical error, they could only seat one of us. We gave it to the other couple. This ended up being a pattern for their other patrons who presumably arrived on time and had to wait. This is a pretty bad error considering how much it happened, but given the rest of the experience, I can't deduct a star over something like this. Just be aware that it happens. They were very busy that day, so it took a while for us to get served, but again, not enough of an issue to deduct a star.\n\nMy boyfriend and I enjoyed the quaint environment and bright colours of the place. It had the same feel as Pop Shop, a grilled cheese place in Collingswood, NJ. It was very cozy, well lit, and country style, what with the counter you can eat at.\n\nWe split an order of blue duck fries to start, and they came in a mountainous pile in a large white bowl. Gouda was melted over them with a healthy portion of green onions, as well as some juicy pulled duck meat. Honestly, our meal could have ended there. We were so pleased with them and devoured them in silence- a sure sign of amazing food.\n\nSince both of us came in wanting eggs benedict, we ordered it. Duck benedict with a perfectly poached egg, topped with more green onion and a SRIRACHA HOLLANDAISE. Yes, you read that. Expecting the usual overly hyped sriracha dish, we were proven wrong when the perfectly textured sauce had a nice sweet finish to it, as true to hollandaise. The bread the benedict was placed on tasted like nothing less than homemade bread (could be wrong, but it was fresh and fantastic). The duck on these eggs was probably 3\/4in thick- it was extremely juicy and was a very generous, flavourful cut. Nothing in the duck benedict overpowered anything else. All fantastic flavours were appreciated and identifiable. \n\nAll in all, service was meh, but the brunch food 100% overshadows any issue we had with the service. A warning, though, the brunch menu is not very extensive. The choices, however, are very diverse in flavour and taste.

The Cajun seafood salad is a must try. Ask them to mix a little of the regular seafood salad with it. You'll love it. The garlic butter shrimp & the Cajun shrimp are delicious. Try the bisque soup.

HOWEVER, If you're going to place an order from this Philly location, expect to wait painfully long for your order. \n\nI placed an order online on a Tuesday evening. The confirmation e-mail stated that the order would be ready in \"approximately 15-25 minutes\". Just to be safe I decided to leave a little later to pick up my pizza.. arriving exactly 45 minutes after placing my order. Upon entering the store, there were no workers in sight. An employee popped her head out  from the kitchen and said \"I just received your order and just started on it\". At the same time she was the only person answering the phone, making the pizzas, and even walking back and forth from the back to the front cashier. \n\n30 minutes later, my pizzas were finally done (a whole hour AFTER the order was placed online). The worker was extremely friendly and I appreciated her hard work; however, I do feel that this location needs more helping hands. 3 stars bc I just love Papa Johns and will probably just end up ordering again. \n\nP.S. Not sure what happened but usually my Papa John's pizza are EXTREMELY WARM when I pick them up AND when I eat them. These pies were strangely almost room temperature within 15 minutes of receiving them \"fresh\" out the oven.

Both the margarita and the sangria were delicious and clearly made of fresh fruits and ingredients.  None of that gross chemical pre-mix taste here.  \n\nThe ordering process was a bit rocky, even though the (small) restaurant wasn't very full when we walked in.  The waitress forgot our drinks and then didn't take our food order, but instead stood at the side of another nearby table, chatting with the patrons while she indicated that the other waiter needed to take our food orders.  Our waiter, I believe the owner, was super cool but VERY high strung.  Like he just got done drinking 25 red bulls right before we arrived high strung.  I asked him if Bjork and Matthew Barney really did like his fajitas, he said they had a sister restaurant in NYC near their house and they came to eat there all the time, in addition they were friends and hung out, and he even catered their children's birthday parties.\n\nThe food was surprisingly delicious.  Everything from the grilled pineapple, salsa, guacamole, chips, huevos were really good.  I was pleasantly surprised,  The food did take awhile to come out though.  The only complaint I had was that the churros were kind of dry.  When I asked for honey to dip them in, they unfortunately were out.\n\nBonus points for all the other entertaining guests.

Honestly, I don't mind that the store is still closed for in-person shopping, because they've made curbside and shipping options so effortless. \n\nI discovered this store a little over a year ago when I was really getting into my fountain pen hobby. Up to this point, I only owned vintage pens and a few newer pens, but I didn't really have any ink other than the cartridges available in generic craft stores. Beyond that, I didn't really understand the compulsion so many of my fountain pen and calligraphy friends seemed to feel regarding unusual inks. Like, don't I need a blue ink, a black ink, maybe a red ink? \n\nNo. No, I also need a gold-flecked strawberry ink, a silver-flecked blue ink, and every other J. Herbin shimmer ink they carry here. Thankfully, they carry several. As far as I can tell, this is the only place in town where you can buy fountain pen-specific ink--calligraphy ink and India ink cannot be used in fountain pens! (That's something I learned AFTER another local independent art store told me otherwise. Had to throw that nib assembly away.) A note about ink: if you use a vintage fountain pen, Herbin ink (non-shimmer) is one of the few ink brands I trust for my vintage pens. It's also extremely reliable.\n\nWell. I fell down that rabbit hole here, and I moved onto paper...another obsession I didn't understand. Then Carson showed me the Midori paper, the Nemosyne paper, the Rhodia paper...and now I have all the paper. The Japanese stationery is so lush for a fountain pen. I can also satisfy my Stabilo, Tombow and Zebra Mildliner crushes here. \n\nThere are several fountain pens sold here, and I love the Platinums, but I'm not really a Lamy or a Kaweco fan. Doesn't matter. They have so many other things that I'll still be around if they add brands I love. I'd rather browse here and find a few wonderful things than plod around a giant store with impersonal service. I'm SUPER excited to try the Midori and Super5 pens! STLAS will tune your nib for you, too!\n\nI need to mention a few other things. If you're looking for  a light box, buy it here. The price is competitive with other local stores and if you have an issue you can exchange it-they're not cheap mail order versions, they carry a quality light box that will hold up over time. \n\nIf you're a calligrapher that uses a dip pen, they have amazing vintage and modern nibs and Dr. Ph. Martin calligraphy ink. Try them with the house notebooks--they make them there!\n\nGive this little shop a try. The block is great and has a total You've Got Mail vibe. They will remember your name after the first visit. And Ellie, the shop dog and General Manager, will most definitely give you a tail wag!","date":"2021-06-16 00:39:54","vector":[-0.05505,0.1525333333,0.0,-0.0024666667,0.0]}

How I missed this gem is beyond me.  It has a great layout, with 2 floors.  They have several paintings of local artists displayed around the store.  The lady who greeted us was friendly and I think she had a dog, which was another bonus.  \nFirst thing that impressed me was the prices.  You could buy brushes on the cheap, like $2, $4, etc.  From what I saw, it looked like they carried imitation brushes, which means they do not use any animal fur in their brushes.  The canvas panel prices were awesome.  We bought 8, 8x10 canvas panels for $10 (That's less than $1 dollar each for all you fuzzy math people out there).  It doesn't seem like they carry any oil paint, but they do  carry acrylic and watercolor.  They do also have children's art supplies like Crayola and RoseArt, so if you are looking for supplies to keep the kiddos busy this summer, they can hook you up.  \nThere was a ton of stuff in clearance and sale (especially on the second floor).

It's a small store that offers a variety of items, candy, cookies, candy bars, pillows, pj bottoms, toys and more. They also have a little room in the far back called the baby room. \n\nThe staff was friendly and helpful with my various inquiries and showing me various gift box selections, etc.\n\n The baskets come in two sizes, small $15.95 which includes 8 pieces of candy and large $32.95 which includes 20 pieces of candy. You also have the option of a candy bag which is 7 pieces for $10.99. You can grab an already made basket or customize your own. They allow you to bring in outside items to add to your basket: chips, rice krispy treats, candy, etc that they do not offer in store which could lower the price of your basket. The baskets are nice in size and well put together. I like the price for what you get and the presentation. I quickly browsed the candy bar selection to see what items they had for me to work with.

I came here for my graduation dinner on Saturday and was very excited to try it out. I should have known from the beginning that this was not a good restaurant. When we called to make the reservation we were told that they would put us down for 7:30pm. A few days  later, they called us back and told us they had to change it to 8pm, and we would have to pay a $100 deposit and that if we chose not to go to the restaurant we would forfeit this payment.\n\nWhen we got to the restaurant it was small, dark, and cramped. The table was small for our large party. It took over 30 mins to get drinks to the table. We also did not receive any bread. One of my guests specifically asked the server if we could get bread, and was told we had to wait. Even though we just saw a nearby table that had just walked in receive bread. They then came out with only two baskets of bread for a table of 21 people. We then waited a substantial amount of time to get soups, salads, and two orders of bruschetta to the table. The plates of bruschetta only come with 3 very small pieces. They were overly sweet and not pleasant at all. The soup did not come out at the same time as the salad. After the salads were done we just sat and waited for a very long time. The people who had ordered soup still did not have it. No refills on drinks, almost everyone at our table had empty drinks and were waiting. We were not asked if we wanted any more bread. We saw tables that came in 50 mins. after us already eating their dinners, yet none of us had ours.\n\nAfter 2 hours of waiting at the restaurant, I had enough. We couldn't even get a refill on our drinks. Everyone at our table was complaining about being hungry, and at this point it was 10pm. We came in from out of town and had a two hour drive back home to look forward to after dinner. Even if we got our food at this point we wouldn't be home until almost 1am. I went to look for the manager myself since there was no server to ask. I managed to find her and told her how disappointed I was at the horrible service. She made an excuse about how it was delayed only because of the soup. At this point I was fuming, and said that the service had been horrible this entire time, and it had nothing to do with the soup. There was no drinks, not enough bread, long waits for anything we asked for, and only one server for a table of 21. 9 members of my family had gone to lunch earlier at another restaurant and had 3 waiters helping them for that small party. When we informed them of the party size 2 weeks prior, there should have been an adequate amount of servers. After saying how disappointed I was, that we had such a long drive home, and that my graduation dinner was completely ruined, she said they would send more people to the table. She had no excuse for why people seated almost an hour after us had already received their food. At this point the restaurant was already starting to empty out.\n\nAfter that we did receive refills on our drinks, but we never saw those additional servers again. It went back to the one original server. We got our food a while after that, and I absolutely hated mine. I got the Ravioli Rosa and it was disgusting and soggy. I sent it back and decided that I just wasn't going to have dinner. My uncle received his chicken and it was not cooked, and was bloody. He sent it back too. Several other guests were unhappy with their meals. The server apologized for my meal and offered me a replacement of my choice, and I deciding to just go the safe route and get their brownie sundae. I figured they couldn't get that wrong. Wrong! It came and it was covered in raspberry sauce on the brownie and the ice cream. I hate raspberry, and had that actually been on the menu's description, I wouldn't have ordered it. I tried it to give it a shot, but just couldn't do it. That was the last of it for me. Everyone ate their meals, said they were mediocre, and waited for the checks. The checks came and were all wrong, several things were on our bill that we hadn't ordered. One guest was charged for a beer and an entire other dinner he hadn't ordered. We were the last table inside the restaurant and we had to suffer through a long drive home. It was the worst decision I made choosing this restaurant. I was starving and hadn't ate the entire day because of this ordeal.\n\nIf you have a large party, or just don't want overpriced food that tastes horrible, avoid this restaurant. There are plenty of other good options on State St. and in the the surrounding areas that have much better food.","date":"2014-10-27 07:59:31","vector":[-0.0350571429,0.076775,0.0618,-0.02145,0.0]}

They have some pretty good and cheap daily specials - you can get a soup, donut and coffee for $4.99. Not to shabby.\n\n- Half a dozen ($4.99) - there were about 20 or so different types of donuts to choose from. So much selection! I can't even remember which ones I picked out now. I tried the apple fritter, honey glazed and coconut (it was like a cake donut with coconut sprinkles), two chocolate glazed (one was honey while the other was maple) and a cruller. \n\nI didn't get to try any of the chocolate glazed ones as they were devoured instantly, always a good sign. The rest were all light and airy. My two favourites were the apple fritter and cruller. My least favourite was surprisingly the honey glazed. It lacked any real flavour - pretty mild. Other than that, everything was good and you could tell they were made fresh, in-house. \n\nCheck them out if you're in the area!

They also have a bar!\nFood:\nThe food is great but a bit lacking in flavor at times. The cheese dip is one of the best I've ever had. The menu isn't too big but has about 3 pages of different foods. The only weird part of the menu is that the desserts don't really match the \"Mexican restaurant\" feel. They have red velvet and chocolate cakes which I have never seen at any other Mexican restaurant. \n\nThe room that it is in is massive. The social distancing is very nice. The employees are great.

I'm pretty sure he brought them with him to Philly. This meal was truly transcendent, and the only downside of the night was that not enough people were there to share in it! PLEASE EAT AT AVANCE. Once word gets out (it's already top 25 new restaurants and likely fast-track for many more), people will flock here from across the country, not too mention the many business dinners that are sure to make this a new favorite.\n\nMy wife and I came out as a post-wedding celebration, and went with the Chef's Tasting as a treat (yes it is pricy, but considering the quality, you'd be paying twice the amount in NYC, DC, SF, etc, so please don't let that deter). Every dish was immaculate, with well balanced flavors, elements from savory to sweet to tart to leave the palette satisfied but not overwhelmed. Moreover, the Chef's techniques were on full display with molecular gastronomy used just enough to enhance the experience without becoming gimmicky.\n\nOur amuse bouches were all intricate, especially given the miniature nature. From \"bacon and egg\" to a potato \"chip\" topped with chicken livers to a squid ink mussel shell each plate was much more than a starter, it really showed a deft hand and drew us into the experience, setting up the tasting menu dishes perfectly.\n\nSeriously though, the plating was art. We took pictures (don't worry we did not use flash and checked with the restaurant) because each plate was just so technical and perfectly designed. The Foie Gras... haunts me. Whipped up and topped with pickled grapes and a side of crunchy walnut and creme fraiche, each bite was perfectly balanced. The richness of the foie, cut by the tartness of the grape and brightness of the creme fraiche all with added texture from the walnuts... Wow.\n\nThe plate of night for me was the cauliflower \"chawanmushi\". The plating was like an ocean landscape with islands of roe, a meyer lemon foam, and seared! bay scallops. Each bite was different, and the richness and creaminess of the custard paired so perfectly, whether it was with the sweet and savory scallop or the burst of the roe. The key to a great dish is that it evokes a memory, and this one is forever etched in my mind.\n\nI'll leave the rest of the menu for each person to taste, but rest assured each course was innovative, balanced, perfectly seasoned, and beautifully plated. Service was immaculate, from knowing which side to serve and remove plates to advising on the menu, it really was a michelin level experience. I mean... who dry ages duck, and sous vides broccoli stems. Someone who truly loves food and the artistry of a perfect meal.","date":"2014-03-16 02:31:34","vector":[0.2662964286,0.0,0.0,0.01041,0.0]}

The sandwich was quite small and had a thin layer of salami and the slice of cheese was so thin I am amazed that it stayed in one piece.  It tasted okay for what it was but it was very underwhelming compared to sandwiches at other places.\n\nThe other less than impressive factor is the noise level.  It has a high concrete ceiling containing exposed ventilation pipes and beams that might look trendy but all it succeeds in doing is reflect sound back down on the assembled patrons.  The place was approximately half full and the noise level was too high, I can only imagine the din at full occupancy.\n\nI would walk 2 blocks further and grad a sandwich at Baba Finks or go to the Italian Bakery and get a far better sandwich.","date":"2017-04-13 19:04:04","vector":[0.1015583333,0.0,0.2023,0.03425,0.0]}

From setting to setting she cleared people out of the way so our shots were of just the two of us.  The courthouse is a public place so this takes some assertiveness.  She was not too shy to ask people to move out of the way.  This ensured we didn't waste time waiting for an open shot, and that we hit every area of the courthouse that we wanted pictures in.  Love.  Love.  Love her.  Will come back and update when pictures arrive.","date":"2017-03-15 23:52:36","vector":[0.0,0.05135,0.0,0.0745,0.0]}

Despite the wait, the restaurant wasn't all that crowded, and getting a table facing the terminal (so I could see my flight status) wasn't difficult at all. Service was quick, and polishing everything off in time and paying was easy as well. As for what you are paying for - the drink selection is a bit limited; they were running low on cocktail ingredients, so I went with the Goose Island Sofie instead - okay on draft but not the best. For the food, I ended up selecting the standard burger with fries. The burger itself was pretty decent - still a bit juicy on the inside but with a nice little char on the outside. The fries, though, were a soggy mess that were a bit oversalted - it did not taste like parmesan fries by any stretch.\n\nI don't fly through STL often, so opining on the food relative to other options is difficult for me. While it will fill you up, the food quality doesn't really strike me as anything better than average (with the fries not meeting that high bar), and the drink selection isn't phenomenal either.

The cashier took my order and I showed her the promo on the McDonald's app. Each register is equipped a special scanner that scans the promo codes which if used properly will apply the promo and 0 out the item or deduct the cost if you order additional items. But for some reason the cashier had never heard of the McDonalds app nor any promos so she left me to call the manager on duty. The manager on duty also was unaware of the McDonalds app and it's promos. The app itself has a location finder and listed this particular location as a participating location of the McDonald's app hence the McDonald's app scanners installed at the registers. The manager on duty looked at the promo and stated she needed to call the store manager to get approval. I waited a total of 7 minutes between the time I walked to the time the cashier and manager on duty did all of these tedious things before my order was even placed in the system. I waited another 4 minutes for my order (free big Mac) to be fulfilled. This all could've been prevented if this location trained their employees on updates to products and services.

There is also some spice they put on it that I can't describe but it was really good. \n\nWe didn't dine inside obviously since you can't do that anywhere right now, but inside seemed clean and well kept when we went in to pick up our food. \n\nTo top it all off, the price was incredible for the amount of food. It was just a little over $5.00 for each cheesesteak. \n\nWe will be going back again and trying some other items on the menu but you can't go wrong with trying them out if you haven't yet.","date":"2020-04-23 22:24:10","vector":[0.1051083333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Excellent taste and portions are above what you would expect for the price   I've had the hush puppies fries and onion rings as sides. All delicious.  They also have slushy drinks which are excellent.  If you go in an order to go it's takes just about 10-12 minutes.  So\nMy 10 wings and a side ran me a little over 8 dollars.

First off the everything is extremely plain. There is absolutely NOTHING special about the food here! My cheesesteak has no onions or peppers. Just meat and cheese and when I bite into it all I taste is grease. Very unpleasant. The wings although tasty because of the sauce was very plain. No seasoning at all. Just deep fried wings tossed in sauce. The shrimp was good, no complaints there. What can I say for a place that has 4.5 stars I expected more and was just disappointed.

She captured emotion, connection, fun and love in the photos all while being behind the scenes. She checked in the perfect amount during the day about the photos we wanted.

I don't often post reviews on the web, but Lindsay's talent deserves to be recognized.\n\nI am a photographer myself. By saying that I don't mean I have a camera and take photos for fun, I mean that my career is as a photographer and I actually collect a paycheck for doing so. I was concerned about finding the right photographer to document our August 2014 wedding the way I wanted it done. We did not want a lot of posed traditional photos; instead we were after someone to document the day, taking lots of candid shots of our guests and us enjoying the time we had together. \n\nThe photography was the one aspect of our wedding that my wife let me handle exclusively, as she knew I would be incredibly picky about the process and the end results. I did a lot of searching on the web, looking at many portfolios and packages from various photographers and companies - when I found Ginger Fox, I stopped looking and immediately contacted Lindsay.\n\nPhotography is an art. You can have all the \"proper camera gear\" in the world be trained on how to use the technology, but if you don't have an eye for the finished product you're just pressing the shutter button on your expensive camera. \n\nFrom the moment she met us at the hotel to document our wedding day, I knew I had selected the right photographer to capture our moments. Lindsay and I discussed again what I was looking for, and she got right to work.\n\nAll day, she was out of sight, out of mind - not in front of us with a camera and a flash hounding us to take photos and take time away from our guests, and we appreciated that immensely. \n\nLindsay is an artist. Every single one of the 700-plus photos she took for us has me staring at my monitor in awe. We had them in our hands two weeks to the day after our wedding and are just thrilled with how they turned out, \n\nPlease, end your search here and hire Lindsay and Ginger Fox Photography for your wedding and engagement needs. You won't be sorry.","date":"2014-08-18 13:51:59","vector":[-0.2263,0.0,0.2553,0.0374625,0.0]}

I cannot recommend her highly enough.\n\nI have been present for three weddings she has shot. One was outdoor in the rain, one was on a farm on a sunny day, and my own was on the side of a mountain in a snow storm and then in a dark mountain lodge. In every setting she has captured stunningly beautiful photos while bringing an incredible positive energy that shines through in her work. When Lindsay is around, everyone wants to join in and have fun and help get the perfect shot.\n\nShe simply brings a contagious energy to any event she shoots. She managed to convince all of our wedding guests to go outside in a blizzard at 7000' elevation for a group shot, and she climbed on a roof to capture the moment perfectly. \n\nShe is also simply a technically phenomenal photographer. She nails the lighting indoors and outdoors, in the rain and sun and snow. She captures stunning group shots and beautiful fine detail shots. \n\nShe even helped us plan out the itinerary for our day to maximize her time and the shots we could get throughout the day.\n\nIf you're looking for someone to capture a big moment, you've found them.  \n\nhttps:\/\/lindsayladd.smugmug.com\/Weddings\/Powers-Hickey\/Marissa-Elicia\/","date":"2019-05-24 20:47:18","vector":[0.0,0.296,0.7184,0.2127214286,0.0]}

I can appreciate the electronic ordering system, as it makes it much easier to combine all of the options you might want to put in for your order.\n\nI will say that the prices have crept even higher, as the in-store prices do not even match the prices shown on the online menu. Speaking of prices, they are a bit higher than I'm used to. This is likely due to the appeal of sushi as \"something different\" and they do have a few items that are likely more expensive to carry versus your run-of-the-mill sushi place. If the first drink wasn't free, though (make sure to signup for the club), my meal would have been almost $12 for a pretty straightforward lunch.\n\nOverall, however, if you set aside the inflated prices, I'd say that the sushi is pretty good overall.","date":"2014-08-28 18:12:05","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.123475,0.0,0.0]}

We asked to sit in a booth, and were easily accommodated as the restaurant wasn't busy on this Friday night. Our server was quick to greet us & take our drink order.\n\nFirst, drinks are 2 for 1, all the time! I ordered sangria, and our sever asked if I wanted half a shot of brandy in it, for no extra charge. Yes, please! Howard had whiskey with a Pepsi chaser. My two sangrias totalled $6, and Howard's two whiskey shots were $5.50 - what a deal, and they were a good size! \n\nI was not impressed with the cheese pizza. While I'm not a tomato sauce fan, this pizza had nearly no sauce at all. It tasted like a giant round cheesy bread. I certainly expected better from CDB's. Plenty of cheese, and it WAS good, but this wasn't really a pizza.\n\nFor sushi, we initially only ordered two California Rolls, because Howard was impatient to order. After we looked at the menu, we decided to get the $12.99 dinner special any 2 rolls among 40 options, plus a miso soup & house salad. Our young server was not flustered one bit by this change, although the kitchen was and one of the California rolls came out much later. The house salad was good, with lots of very fresh lettuce. Our server told us the ginger dressing was made in-house, and while it was good, I didn't really like the flavor. The miso soup, however, was fabulous! Not too salty, yet quite flavorful.\n\nThe three of us shared a Spider Roll & two California Rolls, and we all agreed they were excellent. The rolls were large & plumply filled. In fact, my daughter, a sushi enthusiast, said the quality & flavor was better than most other sushi restaurants she frequents. \n\nWe enjoyed our evening at CDB's\/Sake House, and we'll definitely return for the sushi & drinks...

My son had his best man and ushers each go to their nearest Indochino (NY, Boston, Philadelphia) to get matching suits for his wedding.  Our younger son (the best man) went to the one in Philly.  While the initial measurements and ordering went okay, everything from then on was a string of errors and mishandlings.  The suit was sent to the wrong address, and the shirt was not sent with the suit but rather was sent to the store.  When my son went in to the store for his fitting, not having opened the box, he saw that there were large tears in the left sleeve.  After explaining to the clerk the need for a quick repair or replacement as the wedding date was approaching, he was told that a new one would be ordered.  After a couple weeks, he hadn't heard from the store.  He called to check on the status, and was told that it had come in several days earlier.  My wife and I, now very skeptical, drove an hour from north central NJ to go with him to the store.  When we arrived, we learned that the new jacket had never been ordered.  AT THIS POINT, THE STORE CLERK HE HAD BEEN DEALING WITH ACCUSED OUR SON OF SAYING IN THE EARLIER VISIT THAT HE WOULD BE OKAY WITH WEARING THE TORN SUIT JACKET AS BEST MAN AT HIS BROTHER'S WEDDING!  We were told that we could not possibly have a new jacket before the wedding because the factory was not accepting \"rush orders\", and nothing could be done by the in-house tailor because the particular fabric was no longer available.  They insisted that there was nothing they could do before the wedding.  I told one of the store representatives that I didn't care if they had to find another jacket in the same material and transplant a sleeve to my son's jacket, it must get fixed.  They followed up on that idea, and my son returned to the store a week later to get the repaired jacket.  Mind you that, with very little street parking in that part of town, we paid over $100 in parking alone with all of our trips to the store to get the suit right.  Of all of the issues, I think the most disturbing is the clerk trying to cover her errors by saying that my son had agreed to wear the torn suit.","date":"2015-12-05 02:38:58","vector":[0.0,0.0,-0.25,-0.0249904762,0.0]}

I would say this was probably one of the worst (combination of most awkward and uncomfortable) purchasing\/customer service experience I have ever had!!!!\n\nHoping to get a tailor suit from Indochino, I thought the sale associates would be a lot more helpful but clearly I was wrong.  The sales associate I worked with definitely had the \"i don't want to work on a Sunday\" kind of vibe where she just wasn't motivated to work or be there.  While that made things awkward already, she did not do a great job educating me on the process of how a tailored suit is made at Indochino which left me lost and confused.  \n\nNot knowing the process already, I did not know that Indochino does not carry sample suit jackets for its fabrics, so I had to \"imagine\" what it would look like...  I think that is the most idiotic thing ever!!!  Who the heck would want to purchase a 400 to 800 dollar suit without knowing if the color\/fabric would look good on them.  I'm sorry but I think this is something you guys have to fix because to me a suit is an investment and it's something I want to know I can wear in confidence opposed to my \"imagination\".  \n\nWith that being said, the sales associate continue to disappoint as she failed to make suggestions on what color\/fabric would work well on me (as I would need to \"imagine\" the colors of the suit on me) as I thought sales associates there would be more cultured stylists, but I guessed I was wrong as well.  And on top of that, I asked if I could try on a suit jacket that was on the mannequin to get an idea if I would look good in that color, but she denied me of that which gave me no direction in what or how to purchase from you guys \n\nOverall, Indochino was definitely the worse shopping experience I have ever had.  Please fix up the attitude of your sales associates and the company's sales approach because it is very difficult to purchase something that you have to \"imagine\" what it looks like.","date":"2016-06-27 03:55:19","vector":[-0.0063857143,-0.1339666667,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Was pretty much dead set on buying when I entered the store. Then I met Victoria. I'm pretty sure that was her name. She didn't introduce herself, but I was able to read it off of the necklace she wore. There was something about the way she greeted me that I knew my quest for a suit was doomed. \n\nI didn't have an appointment. A customer already in the store was kind enough to give me his. Maybe he sensed something about Victoria as well. Every question I asked her was answered in a flat, uninterested tone that is familiar if you've ever tried to pick a girl up at a bar who had no interest in even getting a free drink out of it.\n\nI wasn't at a bar though. I tried to be polite and lighten the mood but it seemed to only bring out even more thinly veiled bitterness. \n\nThe process of customizing a suit at Indochino doesn't take more than 20 minutes. But by the time we went through all the questions I was exhausted and annoyed. I need a suit. I walked in with no appointment initially but with my credit card ready to swipe. I was an easy mark for any sales person with an ounce of people skills. Impressively, Victoria made me a do a 180 within five minutes of interacting.\n\nI'll never forget the look on her face after we finished the whole customization -- measurements, lapel notches, lining, buttons, pockets, and on and on -- and she told me the total price expecting me to reach for my wallet, and I told her, \"Oh, you said I have 48 hours to think about it. I need that time. I wasn't planning on buying today.\"\n\nA photo of that exact moment would do more to make people reading this understand Victoria's attitude than any amount of words ever could.

So while the beer and drink menus are extensive and interesting, the food menu, not so much. (Agreeing with my fellow Yelper Kat C., the food is definitely on the mediocre side.) Maybe some good rich or fried bar snacks to go with the beer, which, again, pretty standard for a brewery.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you are sensitive to fried foods, or you are a vegetarian, you probably won't find much here that you'll be able to enjoy. So why would I, falling into both categories, ever do dinner here? Because I had a work dinner to celebrate one of my colleagues. And not just is she one of my colleagues, but she's a colleague that I happen to like very much. What we do for work and for love.\n\nThe ambiance was typical for a brewery on  Thursday night, bustling and moderately loud. Not so loud I couldn't hear the people at my table, and I even caught some of the music on the restaurant loudspeakers (random but great selection). All we ordered were drinks and appetizers (SO MANY DRINKS), so I'll do a quick run-down on the few things I was actually able to eat:\n\nHand-Cut Sweet Potato Fries: I should not even have had the single fry I ate. But it's hard for me to say no to sweet potato fries, especially when they're impossible to do wrong, so you can always count on them to be good.\n\nMargherita Flatbread: Nope. Thick mozarella slices (was that REALLY fresh mozarella?) over too-sweet tomato sauce, barely any basil, and slightly soggy pita-esque bread. It's obvious I was disappointed, right?\n\nNachos: Another one that's hard to mess up, and IHB did not. The beans, vegetables and sour cream were all good, and plenty of yummy guacamole too.\n\nFried Brussels Sprouts: Another item that I should not have eaten, but probably my favorite of everything I ate. Crisp and well-seasoned, just really tasty overall. Almost worth the stomach ache I've still got after eating three pieces.\n\nHousemade Soft Pretzel Sticks: I don't know what the fuss over these is about. With all the great reviews, this was the item I was most looking forward to. But while the cheese and mustard sauces were good, the pretzels I just wasn't into. They were kind of buttery, Amish style, which I know is popular, but I just can't get into it. And \"everything spice\" is for bagels, not pretzels! I feel like it's not just me either, because my table of 7 barely managed to finish the 5 sticks that came in the order.\n\nWe ordered a lot of carnivore-friendly and other fried appetizers too, but since I didn't try those, I won't mention them here. Given the space and the location, the prices are what you'd expect. But for the quality? Maybe next time I'd do happy hour here and get dinner somewhere else (at least, if I have a say in the matter).","date":"2019-07-12 01:46:42","vector":[0.0941,0.0,0.0,0.1097714286,0.0]}

It's actually open from 11:30 to Midnight, not Noon. We have walked past it the last three days while wandering around Philadelphia during our visit. We decided to give it a go on our last evening here looking for some small plates as opposed to a big meal. \n\nIt's a beautiful in house craft brewery which is very popular in our neck of the woods so we are quite familiar with the concept. Beer is not our thing so we will leave those that know way more about that to comment on the offering of suds that their offering. \n\nWe can tell you that the pretzel sticks are great and the cheese dip was also excellent although could use a little infusion of sharp cheese to make it outstanding. The grainy mustard dip to us was a touch to heavy on the acid and could have used a bit of sweetness to cut the acidity. \n\nThe Caesar salad was good with a generous amount of food even with the starter salad which we split. The croutons were tasty and the Parmesan cheese plentiful. I like a bit more anchovy than was evident, but others I know do not, so I am likely in the minority there. \n\nWhere the fifth star was earned were the buffalo wings which were HUGE! The appetizer wings are $13.00 and include 10 wings or so our server told us. We got 11 and it might be because they were on the light side as far as weight goes (kidding, check out the photo). They were very tasty and there was no way the lovely K and I could finish them. Suffice it to say we have lunch already for tomorrow as we brought 6 back to our hotel room. \n\nThe place was rocking busy, but even at that the food came out quickly and the service was very good.

Tonight we went in and noticed that they changed the menu. \nThe menu is a little more upscale and pricey... but we're ok with that if the food is great.\nI ordered the Kobe burger and it may be the best burger I've ever had. We're from Kansas City so it's hard to please those of us raised on the best beef in the nation. It was superb. Also the wedge is new on the menu, and I'm a huge wedge lover. This also may be the best wedge I've ever had. I don't like too much dressing just enough to get that blue cheese mixed with bacon yumminess....Wow...super good!\n\nWe love having a neighborhood go-to spot.

My sister lives up in Somersett and we generally just pass right through as they haven't heard great things  about the community restaurants, but we stopped in for breakfast last week and when I asked the waitress what she would recommend, she said the Huevos Rancheros. I am all for trying staff favorites, and was very pleased with the decision as it was perfectly prepared and the enchilada sauce was absolutely delicious. The only thing I didn't like was that there was an 18% gratuity added automatically because it is a \"private establishment\" but yet, the public in the community is still allowed, a bit confusing and when we asked the server if we could leave a larger tip, she said yes, but we prefer you leave cash, which I also found to be a lot a bit  ODD. \n\nWe asked to see a dinner menu and the menu looks absolutely phenomenal and I will definitely be coming back to try some dishes. Minus one star for the lack of ambience, and it basically is a double wide trailer from the outside, but they've done a bit to spruce up the inside. TV's were on really loud, and it just seems more bar-sy than I would have expected given the absolutely amazing food. \n\n- My sister had the \"First Hole Breakfast\" which was a great price, and the coffee is free, so that was also great. All in all, looking forward to coming back and seeing how they perform for diner. Great how convenient it is for the locals.","date":"2015-03-05 01:59:57","vector":[0.29455,0.0,-0.0516,-0.1591,0.0]}

After being vacant for years, this new eatery was receiving rave reviews, which is rare for a just-opened establishment.  Happy to say, this place hit the mark, mostly.\n\nLocated in the Towne Center in Somersett, it's easy to find, plenty of parking.  The vibrant atmosphere is amplified by the pirate d\u00e9cor and open-beamed ceilings.  The eating area itself is decent size with tables and booths; the place was packed this past Friday night.  We were greeted right away, though our table was not ready.  We were asked to wait in the attached bar.  If you are not a smoker or do not care for cigar smoke, this will be a turn off as it's a cigar bar and smells like it!  Upside, we were comped our first round of drinks...downside, this is where they dropped a star.  We asked for a couple of Manhattans and a lemon drop martini...20 minutes later, still waiting.  To our surprise, we noticed the bartender looking through recipe cards and searching on her phone...hmmmm.  We were saved, as our table was ready.\n\nNow the best part.  Service was prompt, friendly and on the mark.  Our drinks finally arrived and were provided with water and yummy garlic bread (hot out of the oven).  Placed our new drink and app orders.  Crispy calamari and stuffed mushrooms were quickly devoured.  A definite must off the app menu.\n\nFor our mains, my wife ordered the scallops and I ordered the sea bass.  Ruth Chis loss, Gambis gain!  WOW!  Both plates were decent sized, the scallops second only to 4th Street Bistro (sorely missed!).  Cooked to perfection...tender, juicy, sweet.  Served on a bed of parmesan risotto that was creamy and full of flavor, along with tender, yet crisp asparagus, perfect accompaniment. The sea bass came out perfect...seared and juicy on the inside, topped with whole pistachio crust, layered on top of spinach and a unique parsnip\/vanilla puree that sounds weird but was a perfect match for the fish.  Hats off!!\n\nWe so hope they keep it going, as we will certainly be back...though we'll have drinks at home first!!","date":"2021-08-23 18:45:43","vector":[0.0715809524,0.4939,0.0,0.1018277778,-0.0114]}

While my latte was hella cute with the heart foam, it was super acidic - like burnt coffee. And my avocado toast.... tears were shed for this. I'm not sure how you mess up avocado toast, but it was awful. It was supposed to be avo, feta, basil drizzle and micro greens. I'm not positive that there was even basil drizzle. The biggest flaw was the salt content - woof. It was inedible. And the feta was massive. Now I am a cheese fanatic - but bad feta and too large. They need to use crumbles and mix it in. \n\nAs far as aesthetics, it's a tiny space in Grimeys so can't knock that. And their outdoor patio is cute, with the mural. The standing room during ordering is super tight. In the land of beautifully designed restaurants, it's meh. \n\nSo to wrap up - go to other coffee places on 8th like 8th & Roast. Or to Belmont for Proper Bagel.","date":"2017-07-13 12:17:55","vector":[0.0837909091,0.0,0.0,0.2641555556,0.0]}

We were greeted by a very friendly bartender (I believe his name was Bobby) who quickly took our drink order. \n\nAs for food, we ordered quite a bit of the menu items because we wanted to try a little bit of everything, and we were absolutely famished. I am pretty obsessed with the platter - I think it was called the Pol-Richmond Platter - It has keilbasa from Swiacki's, pierogi from Czerw's, and some of the best sauerkraut I've ever had. The pierogi filling also rotates, That alone will bring me back over and over again!\n\nSome other stars were the fried cauliflower, the seasoned french fries with dipping sauce (which are 1,000 times better than Chickie's & Pete's, by the way), and those wonderful cheesesteak egg rolls with sriracha ketchup dipping sauce. Man oh man, their food is damn good.\n\nAs it is with any of Scoats' spots, the beer selection was on point and had something for everyone. The prices were just right, the decor is beautiful and perfectly suited to the neighborhood, and Bobby's service was very enjoyable.

Only problem was is that when I got home they didn't even put the string bean chicken in the box, they completely forgot about it even though I was specifically waiting for that dish. The mushroom chicken had no veggies in it so I just received the chicken from that. I asked for a teriyaki sauce twice but never received that either. Definitely won't be coming in for awhile.

I, the only adult in this area who has never been to Panda Express, have finally been to Panda Express.\n\nI was on a shopping trip, and late one Sunday afternoon I stopped into the Nora location, since I knew dinner would be late tonight.  My daughter goes google-eyed when you mention PE, so I thought I'd see why.\n\n\"Nancy\" was behind the counter. Nancy was sweet, kind, and helpful, but needs to speak up a bit, as her soft voice was almost over powered by the exhaust fans(?). Nancy busied herself stirring the food to keep it from burning on the bottom.\n\nIt may have been the time of day, but the Orange Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken I ordered were badly overcooked, limp and lacking in crispness. I tried the Kung Pao first. WARNING! PE cooks the hot peppers in the mix! If you don't like spicy, PICK THE PEPPERS OUT. But something in the recipe felt like I was eating wet newspaper, sticking to my teeth, but dissolving as I chewed. Trying the Orange Chicken next, I found the culprit -- the breading on the chicken. It was soft and sugary sweet. The orange taste overpowered by soy sauce.\n\nThe Fried Rice was dry and tasteless. Two bites and I left the rest on the plate. I was also disappointed in the drink, even!! I wanted iced tea with no sweetener. PE didn't have that,serving only sweet tea and a low-quality passion fruit tea. I got a Diet Pepsi, but the syrup mix was so badly done that is was undrinkable. Shoulda got water!\n\nI will admit that the price was amazingly low ( less than $8.00), but this does not excuse the low quality.  \n\nNOW, I remember why I've not eaten at Panda Express before. I used to have a Siamese cat named Panda, a dear sweet pet that left too soon. Given the name of my pet and the rumors about Chinese restaurants and cats, I just couldn't do it!\n\nHave to remind myself of that the next time I am tempted by Panda Express.","date":"2017-01-22 22:23:10","vector":[0.0230363636,0.0,-0.3384,-0.074,0.0]}

After ordering the required two entree dinner (being taken to go for a housemate), I presented my coupon at the register.  The price for two entrees was $6.69. (A single entree on their menu board was $3.39.)  The young, female associate only discounted me $1.50.  When I corrected her that it should be $3.35, $3.39, or a third (free) entree, she argued with me, had a poor attitude with sarcastic tone of voice and called (in a foreign language) to another female associate in the back room.  I did NOT appreciate this at all!  If you're working in an area where English is the common language and are speaking with an English-speaking patron, I expect the associates to speak English, not speak in a foreign language so they can speak ABOUT me in a derogatory manner.  This is terribly unprofessional.  When the second employee likewise would not honor the coupon, I requested my coupon back, handed my food back to them, and left.  I will NOT return to this location unless these gals are reprimanded and taught to do math.  I tried to leave feedback on the Panda Express website, but they obviously do not want to be bothered since they only allow 400 characters and their FB page is full of negative consumer experiences that have not been satisfactorily addressed by corporate.

First off, my food.  Ordered the most popular dish which was perogie breakfast.  I asked for eggs over easy and got scrambled.  The eggs glistened with flap top grease.  Scrambled eggs should NEVER be greasy.   4 sausages which were over cooked then split length wise and over cooked again.  This is usually a sign that they cook a massive amount of sausage then reheat it on the flat top.  Perogies were cheap store boughts,  for a heavily Ukrainian populated city there is no excuse to serve Cheemo's in a resturaunt.  Coffee- Do they even have Fu**ing filters.  I was chewing on grounds so much it was a work out.  When I ran out of coffee I had to ask for a refill because the owner \/server wasn't paying attention.  After 15 minutes I had to ask again because he forgot.  After I left I was sick to my stomach from cheap grease.  Sidenote:  The owner\/server had to borrow a pen and disturb the table beside because he forgot to bring one to take the order. \n\nI ate alone so it was easy to observe what was going on around me.  The table across had 6 people and 2 orders were completely forgotten.  The owner interupted there meal\/ conversation several times to discuss whatever was on his mind.  \n\nThe decor is cheap and familiar of a hospital cafeteria .\n\nUpon arrival I waited 10 minutes while I watched the owner having a conversation with a friend.

You can also put together your own Eggs Benedict concoction.\n\nFor vegans, they serve a Tofu Scramble.\n\nThere are a number of Eastern European and Asian accents on the menu due to the ethnicities of the owners. \n\nThere's some great local art on the walls, which I believe is for sale.

I had to ask for water several times and for them to check on my order. \n\nSkewers- get the ginkgo nuts, chicken liver, skirt steak, and chicken thigh. They use a really delicious sauce and know how to keep the meat nice and tender. I dislike liver generally but this one was amazing. The steak was cooked to perfection as well. I would skip the lamb skewers and chicken gizzard, the dry rub was only OK and tasted a bit dry\n\nPork jowl, negi hamachi and yellowtail rolls, potato salad, grilled mackerel - defintrly get these items especially the rolls. The fish was so fresh and the rice to vinegar ratio was spot on. The mackerel was so tender and flavored nicely, you could taste the freshness and how sweet the meat was. Pork jowl and potato salad were solid choices as well\n\nCold tofu - do not get this, no flavor and the tofu is literally the kind you get from the supermarket\n\nOverall it was a good meal and I liked the interesting selection of drinks they had. The food was pretty good and very authentic. Glad I found this on my last night in Philly.

I like to gauge Japanese restaurants by these two menu items as a way to know what to expect and they absolutely knock it out of the park.

This \"small\" 12-inch pizza had enough girth to easily feed three people. The crust was on the thicker side, with delicious crusty cheese melted over the top. I went straight pepperoni - strictly because I couldn't resist the pattern of cheese, pepperoni, cheese, pepperoni. That's the stuff dreams are made of. It was delicious (and this is coming from a provel fan) - the perfect cold day lunch.\n\nWe also tried the fettuccini alfredo that came out after the pizza because they cook it, then take the extra step to melt cheese on top in the oven (what'd I tell you about the cheese at this place). It was good, but although the plate was piping hot, the pasta was only luke warm. Weird.\n\nAnyway, this place was a delight. I will completely be coming back because the service was so friendly and the pizza was unique.","date":"2012-11-27 20:55:48","vector":[0.1229166667,0.0,0.0,0.16522,0.0]}

Grilled chicken, shrimp and sausage with penne noodles in a Cajun Alfredo sauce with fresh onions and red peppers. Yes. This is very good. The noodle, the sauce, everything was well prepared and delivered so hot I had to be careful.\nThe second time I had Chicken Scampi, Chicken breast saut\u00e9 with mushrooms, roasted garlic, green onions and Portabella mushrooms in a garlic butter\/wine sauce on angel hair pasta.

The location is a little off (not in a retail area) but it was a soul food joint and the owners have a done a good job improving its appeal inside and out. The outside is still a little drab, but the inside is simple and nice. The menu offers a good mix of Italian cuisine including pizza, pasta, traditional entrees, salads and desserts.\n\nEvery time I've gone in there, it has been later afternoon for lunch before work. I have had 4 different items and they have all been good, not great, but good. I will say that the menu is VERY reasonably priced ($7-$19) so you get your money's worth with the portions.\n\nFOOD: The first time I ordered the chipotle chicken panini, which was good. I got a salad as a side instead of fries and I was surprised how large the side salad was. One of the highlights was the red pepper vinaigrette, which was bold and tasty. The second time, I got a pizza and it's my favorite item so far. The menu boasts about 16 different varieties of pizza, so there is plenty to choose from. I ordered the Billy Goat (Olive Oil, Minced Garlic, Light Mozzarella Cheese, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Fresh Tomatoes) and it was delicious. The crust was perfect (not too thick\/thin) and the toppings were plentiful. Most recently, I tried the Greek salad with chicken (A mix of Field Greens and Romaine Lettuce with Kalamata Olives, Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Roasted Whole Garlic Cloves, Red Onions,Feta and cheddar Cheeses, drizzled with Greek Dressing (Roasted Red Pepper Vinaigrette).  It was good, but didn't really have the typical flavor of a Greek salad, but for $9 it was filling. Overall, I would recommend the pizzas. They are 10 inches, perfect size to split with another person and they are tasty.  \n\nSERVICE: The service has been great. Each time I've been there, it's the same staff working and they remember me and we exchange small talk about whatever we talked about last time. They are super friendly and the girl who usually serves me, knows about the menu and was able to answer my questions.\n\nATMOSPHERE: The inside is really nice and they even have a small room in the back that someone can rent out. They have a full bar (including specialty drinks). My only complaint about the bar is that the chairs are too low for the high bar, so eating at the bar is a chore. Otherwise, the dining room is welcoming. I was a little turned off that the most recent time I was in some workers were doing repairs in the restaurant and they had tools and metal scattered about, but as a new restaurant, I understand and this doesn't hold too much weight for me.  The bathroom is a single staff (which I don't love if a restaurant is crowded), but once again, this doesn't make or break a place for me.\n\nTO SUM IT UP ....\n\nPERKS: Menu variety, good price, friendly staff, plenty of free parking, clean dining room\n\nNEGATIVES: Location, food good but not great (except pizza), no kids menu (that I've seen), still repairing\/doing maintenance inside dining room, odd seating at the bar.","date":"2013-05-18 19:53:00","vector":[0.0901488372,0.213875,0.36345,0.064908,0.0]}

The experience started off positively as the d\u00e9cor is lovely. We noticed immediately as we sat that we were one of only three tables in the place, on a Friday night - where was everybody?  In retrospect, that should have been red flag #1.  \n\nThe menu looked great - filled with authentic Italian dishes, as well as a variety of pizza options. We ordered the bruschetta, chicken alfredo and chicken marsala. As we sipped our wine we waited in anticipation - we love real authentic Italian food! (Trust me, we are NOT Olive Garden fans.)\n\nOur second red flag was when our bruschetta arrived topped with what appeared to be shredded  cheese from a bag. Now, I may have even looked past this, had the cheese at least been white (\"mozzarella\") but no, it was orange (cheddar? mo jack? not sure)  We thought that was a little odd, but the serving was huge and otherwise tasty, so we let it go. But I certainly would not call this bruschetta \"authentic.\"\n\nMain course time, and time for red flag #3: the hubs' chicken alfredo came without a spoon. To most - not a huge deal, but come on - how are you 'sposed ta twirl??  Other than that, the chix-alf was OK - just OK. It seemed the pasta wasn't stirred in the pot or tossed once it was drained, because lots of the noodles were stuck together. The sauce was tasty enough, but VERY thick. The chicken itself was fine. Just fine.\n\nMy chicken marsala was also OK....just OK. My favorite thing about a really good authentic chicken marsala is a flavorful marsala reduction sauce. My sauce was thin and seemed to rely on garlic to flavor it, but still managed to be bland. The chicken was OK - not cooked wonderfully, not terribly. Just OK. \n\nWould I return to 12 South Bistro? Not based on our experience tonight. They may do better with their red-sauce dishes or their pizzas, but I can't speak to those items personally. \n\nPOSITIVES: The d\u00e9cor was simple and attractive. The atmosphere is quiet and pleasant. The location is great - very close to the Gulch but off the beaten path.\n\nNEGATIVES: The food was simple, not what I'm looking for in an authentic Italian restaurant.","date":"2013-11-02 02:34:45","vector":[0.0622423077,0.0,0.0,0.3262666667,0.0]}

I guess it's after all soul food, so slightly on the greasy side. But it's also depending on what you ordered.\n\nWe get the famous \"deviled egg\" which is fine. I would recommend subtracting one or two components from the topping. It is a little too much and overall, it just tastes like mush mash.\n \nWe tried the \"roasted marrow\". I feel this is more like a concept rather than a real dish. There is really nothing much you can get from the femur bone cavity. Maybe they should talk to the butcher and get the \"joint\" part (the ball-like part) where the real hidden gem marrow is. In china, we eat them by straw. Really guiltily delicious! The bread that paired with it is really really good though!\n\nI have always wanted to try the tofu entry Donburi, and it is definitely the highlight of the whole meal. It is more like a bibimbap with an American twist. It has a lot of toppings but not too heavy. The kimchi is a winning choice and the slow-poached egg is the best! If I could change one more thing, I probably will increase the ratio of seasoned hoisin to mayo. So that the dish is less like a giant Americanized sushi bowl.\n\nOverall, it is a little bit expensive but the food is innovative and worth trying out. Just think twice and be careful when you order.\n\nAt last, I appreciate the effort the chef made on the Asian twist. But sometimes, less is more. The dishes need a highlight instead of just adding more stuff. If possible, I hope the team can really experiment more before finalizing each dish. So just adding the most key \"Asian threads\" without overwhelmed.","date":"2016-07-03 17:02:14","vector":[0.1146826087,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

This place is seriously \"from the old country.\"\n\nDinner at Mario's isn't a plate of food thrown at you to get you out in an hour. Dinner is an EVENT.  Plan on a couple of hours to eat drink some wine, eat some appetizers, and enjoy a very fantastic meal. You are going to want to have a healthy appetite and pace yourself through the experience. The warm bread is tempting to go through the whole loaf but then you would miss out on the dinner.\n\nPersonally I ordered the stuffed pork chop and could not have been happier with the selection. Very tender, moist, and plentiful. The spinach \/ cheese stuffing was a great accent to the chop but not overpowering. Served with a side of fresh veggies that were spot on. We also had the calamari appetizer and  the mixed meat and cheese plates. Both very fresh and prepared very well. \n\nThe wait staff was dealing with our party of 12+ and the ordering was a little confusing as was the bill. They still write on food tickets and the itemization was a little difficult to figure out. Well worth the hassle for such great food, however.","date":"2015-01-19 22:16:41","vector":[0.1814235294,0.0,0.0,0.1591,0.0]}

However, it came with some fried polenta wedges, which were good and quite a surprise.  Except for the polenta, the salad was no different from what is bought in a plastic container at the supermarket.  It had a strange chemical aftertaste that lingered to the next morning, I believe from the Caesar dressing.  \n\nWith tax and a 20% tip, the total bill was $35 for two salads.

Tucked in behind the Chateau Louis hotel on Kingsway Avenue, the Chateau Louis Liquor store has a something for everyone.\n\nThis isn't just your typical chain liquor store, but rather a store that has put some thought into the products they sell. For example, being a wino I like to have a good selection of wine and that they do; from the high end Chileans to great Canadian selections. Let's not forget to mention beer and spirits. They have a great selection of Scotch and beer. Hey, the big sign outside says beer and they don't disappoint from main stream Kokanee to local micro breweries. \n\nThe staff has always been courteous and helpful whenever I've been in, which makes me more inclined to stop. Also, it's convenient being right across the parking lot from a grocery store as it takes moments to pop in and get the perfect beverage for your meal or snacks!","date":"2010-04-15 13:31:37","vector":[0.1680076923,0.0,0.0,0.2797,0.0]}

No offense to these spots as they have really good selections of wines and liqueurs, however, I appreciate Chateau Louis for the parking :-) and the unpretentious staff who when I ask a question, I get a simple answer and am not disregarded if perhaps they haven't heard of something I am looking for as if it doesn't exist (when I know it does).\n\nOn this last trip, I happily found sparkling Reisling at Chateau Louis that I hadn't noticed nor was alerted to such when I went to another establishment and was looking for Reislings to go with a dinner party I was hosting.  As well, they also feature nice wines (not Naked Grape, which I always see on sale everywhere) on SALE, for REAL (I got bottles of Fassini Primitivo for 10.98$ a bottle....a really nice and smooth red)...haven't seen it anywhere for this price, EVER.\n\nThey offer the same \"case\" discount as other spots, give you airmiles and you can wheel your buggy out so you don't have to carry all your wine in your arms (or make multiple trips to the car and back).....AND it is across the way from Canadian Superstore (how handy is that? ;-) ).  The only downside is if you also enjoy Grappa, they do not have a big selection of that....I don't like it, but my companion enjoys it and didn't find any there....oh well.  \n\nNo, they don't have \"wine\/beer tastings\/samplings\", but then again, I am not going to a shop because they have samples (you go to a wine tasting event for that).  I go to a wine shop because I have faith in the advice\/assistance staff can provide, selection, and YES the price point offered ....\n\n:-)  Happy Shopping for your holidays and celebrations :-)","date":"2014-12-21 22:02:21","vector":[0.11252,0.4215,0.0,-0.0246,0.0]}

We walked in and I was surprised by how empty it was on a night with free entertainment but not put off at all by the quiet. We realized immediately from the chalkboard that we actually had to spend $5 each at the bar to play for free. This wasn't a problem at all as we were planning on drinking anyway. We arrived around 5:45 and as the night went on the place started to populate. We played a game of pool and four games of darts. The dart machine was still taking money but our server, Sara R., gave us all the quarters we needed to play until it ended at 7. The only reason I'm giving the place 4 stars instead of 5 is that there were not real tables to eat at except high tops, which is cool but we kinda wanted to have a more intimate dinner.

I was not there during happy Hour, so unsure of that, but from what I have been told, nothing special price wise. When I order house wine out ( and that was the only option) and don;t get at least 1\/2 a glass, I have a problem, I don't care what the price is, so okay they are stingy on wine, but the bartender was great and very nice. The BBQ steak sandwich was on special for $5.00, I got that with some thing removed, making it a Philly cheese steak. It is small, like 7\" on a decent roll, NOT packed with steak, under seasoned and cheese laying on top 1\/2 melted, it was small. . There were plenty of fries, they were NOT spicy, they were not greasy, they were decent fries, nothing special.\nWhat really surprises me is the menu, it had the dumplings and eggrolls, with different Ingredients than the Iguana. They have dishes with ingredients you don't usually come across, especially in a pool hall pub, like ell sauce! I was happy to see the variety on the menu and had a hard time deciding what to eat.Since I changed their sandwich I can\"t really judge it fairly, so I am not going to factor it into this review\nI am very happy to find out there is another option for food and drink in that area.

Prior to this experience, I hadn't eaten LC since my childhood 20 years ago.  It'll probably be at least this long before I return.  Long story short, I got off work late and didn't feel like cooking.  I've always been a bit leery of this place, but laziness took over and I was reeled in by the \"Hot and Ready\" concept.  \n    The place was filthy, even for a busy weekend night.  I won't say the guy working the counter was rude, because that would imply he had a personality whatsoever.  I ordered the $10 deep dish combo and he ran my credit card, slapped the pizza and crazy bread on the counter and muttered a barely audible thank you.  \n    I got home to find my \"pizza\" was actually a burned piece of bread with overcooked cheese and a skimpy amount of pepperoni.  (To be fair, the sauce was surprisingly OK).  They obviously took the opposite approach with the crazy bread, which tasted like it hadn't come within 5 feet of an oven and was doused in a chalky garlic-ish seasoning.  \n    I understand that you get what you pay for, but this was really bad!  Trust me, you'd be better off taking the extra few minutes to pick up a Digiorno or Tombstone.  You'd save a couple bucks and have a tastier pizza.....","date":"2013-12-15 06:16:01","vector":[0.0848,0.0,0.4939,0.0495375,0.0]}

The Culinary part of NAIT, including Ernest's is a bit of a walk from the station, but you can go inside the school and not have to worry about the weather (it was raining outside so that was nice). It was a bit confusing trying to find the restaurant from this way (I'd also never been to NAIT before), but after going through the market foodcourt part the restaurant was there, if a little tucked away. If it helps the restaurant is in Building U Room 121 (U121). \n\nErnest's looks at functions just like a real function, except it's run by the Culinary Arts Program at NAIT. The hostess greeted me and asked for my reservation, which I made online at Open Table. She wasn't able to find it, but it was early in the day and I got seated quickly. \n\nThe waitress who took care of me was very friendly. Ernest's has a small menu, with a few drinks, appetizers, main courses, and desserts. The menu is what some might consider high end, but the prices are actually very reasonable. Appetizers and desserts were around $6-$8 each and the main courses were $12-$15. For lunch that's really nice. \n\nI didn't order a drink or an appetizer even though they looked amazing (especially that rhubarb smash). The waitress brought out some bread and butter, just a couple of small slices, but they were delicious. Maybe I'm crazy, I want to say I tasted the slightest hint of lemon in the bread. It might have not been lemon, but there was just a little bit of brightness in the bread, which was delicious. \n\nThe main course I got was The Country Style Fried Chicken. It comes on top of a truffled coleslaw, corn relish, and spicy chestnut honey. I took a small spoonful of the relish, which was delicious and sweet. Then I went to cut into one of the three pieces of chicken and noticed it was pink inside, with obvious blood. A slightly raw steak that's okay, raw chicken is not. \n\nI think the mark of a good restaurant isn't necessarily whether or not it's perfect 100% of the time, but what the restaurant does when a problem arises. Bloody chicken is a problem, and when I flagged down the waitress and pointed out the issue she was quick to apologize and took the dish back to the kitchen to have it fixed. She was very nice and apologized again letting me know that I would get a comped dessert. \n\nAfter several minutes the dish came back, and I checked the chicken and everything was cooked fine. The dish was delicious, a fantastic combination of sweet and little spicy. The chicken was crispy and not at all greasy. \n\nAbout halfway through my meal someone else, an instructor perhaps, came to check on my meal and make sure everything from before was resolved. She then said the entire meal would be comped. I really didn't feel that was necessary, the main course perhaps, but I think this mistake was an honest one. Definitely not a good one to make, but then again I'm sure other fine dining establishments have served an undercooked chicken dish at one point or another. \n\nI decide to get dessert, not because the entire meal was going to be comped, but because the desserts looked delicious. I got the milk chocolate mousse, which came with a chocolate cake chocolate cake, a port infused pear, and mandarin granite. It also came with several delicious fruit decorations (raspberries and a strawberry). This was delicious - I only wished I had a little knife or something because it was really hard getting the granite and cake on my spoon (it kept sliding off). \n\nDuring my dessert I was approached again by someone from the program, maybe another instructor, who apologized for the incident with the main course, and said that would be comped. I figured that would be fine. It wasn't the dessert that was the problem, and I'm really not the kind of person to insist on a comped meal because of a mistake (I've worked customer service jobs so I know that mistakes happen - we're all human).\n\nI would like to give Ernest's 5 stars because the food was delicious, the service was fantastic, and the price and portions were great. However because of the mistake and because there was a little miscommunication between the people working (first comped dessert, then a comped meal, then a comped main course) I have to give Ernest's 4 stars. I did really enjoy my meal here, and I think it's fantastic the students in the Culinary Program get real restaurant experience and make some really tasty creations. They were very helpful and I look forward to trying Ernest's again, perhaps during one of their highly recommend Friday Buffets or during Dinner.","date":"2015-09-16 02:31:53","vector":[0.1064442308,0.0,0.0,-0.0093363636,0.0]}

This is one of those places that feels like a well kept secret that only \"people in the know\" know about. Who would guess that culinary gold can be found in NAIT's Hokanson Centre for Culinary Arts? Not I, but we decided to rectify the situation. Making a reservation is easy (do it online) and you can even get free parking if you reserve early enough (see here). I probably should have kept that on the DL, oops.\n\nThe lunch menu is small with three appetizer, six entrees and three desserts to choose from. The prices are really what sets them apart and is one of the reasons I wanted to check them out! Apparently, this was the first year that Ernest was open for May, hope that becomes an annual tradition.\n\n- Farmers market salad ($7.00) - this changes daily but when we went, it was an arugula and fennel salad with three salmon cakes hidden underneath. The salmon cakes were unreal. Perfectly deep fried and crispy on the outside, soft and luscious on the inside. The fact that they had three was icing on the cake. Perfect to share with our odd number!\n- Cold smoked scallops ($11.00) - quinoa mint salad, confit tomatoes and lemon vinaigrette. Again, three scallops was perfect for us as we each were able to try one. The scallops were BOMB. For $11.00 freaking dollars, this is a steal. Especially when you compare it to the scallops I had recently at The Marc (those were just as delicious but way more $$$).\n\n- Crusted lamb loin ($16.00) - Israeli couscous, roasted carrots, green beans, pea shoots and Mediterranean spices. The lamb loin was exceptionally good. Wow, I was impressed with how gamey and flavourful the lamb was. It was cooked perfectly to a medium rare.The Israeli couscous was also really good. I need to start incorporating more of these healthy grains (couscous, quinoa, barley, etc.) into my diet. So good for you and full of flavour!\n- Beef striploin ($16.00) - smoked fingerlings in a reduction sauce. The striploin was good but as DBones confessed to me afterwards, once he had a bite of my lamb, it was game over. His beef was tasty but bland in comparison to the lamb.\n- Bouillabaisse ($14.00) - this was their catch of the day. Filled with fish, mussels, and shrimp, there were also two pieces of grilled bread and the broth was some sort of saffron base. Bbop enjoyed the dish - at first, he wasn't sure but the dish won him over by the end. I had a bite of the fish and it was a bit dry, almost had a rubbery texture to it. I've ate bouillabaisse several times in Montreal but that's probably an unfair comparison. It was a good effort, let's go with that.\n\nFine dining at a fraction of the price. You won't even notice that the servers and kitchen is run by students. Our waiter was excellent and our food (all three of our entrees) came out at the same time (a la Hell's Kitchen style). Impressive, you don't even see that at regular fine dining restaurants in Edmonton. I'll have to try out their four course table d'h\u00f4te menu ($38.00\/person) once they open back up in September. They also have Friday buffets ($30.00\/person including tax and gratuity) if AYCE is more your jazz.","date":"2015-06-12 05:01:20","vector":[0.0863210526,0.28595,-0.1525666667,0.17865,0.0]}

Haha, I'm not even kidding when I say this.  The restaurant serves as a means to train NAIT's culinary and hospitality services students. The exploits include some really nice fine dining food, in a buffet style, with excellent service.  They are almost always booked and I can see why! \n\nI wouldn't say that the food I ate here was the best I've ever eaten. There were some fantastic high points though. The arancini balls were perhaps among the best I'd had.  Basically, arancini is deep fried risotto balls.  They made it with wild mushroom and  taleggio cheese and the medley of flavors was fantastic!  The other main courses were decent too.  Lots of small bites like canop\u00e9s, light salads, terrines and housemade breads and so on.  Decent vegetarian options too.\n\nThe desserts were again pretty good.  Fresh baked croissants, house made chocolates and truffles that were freaking delicious and, of course, the incredibly delicious banana fosters.  The fosters were the high point for me.  They also had small ganaches and other finger-food desserts that were pretty decent too.  Yummy desserts to end the night!  \n\nWhile the food is generally good, one could see that this is a means to train NAIT students. There were some misses, like roasted chicken in a buffet style setting, where the chicken was a bit dry.  However, for the price, it's worth giving it a try because there will certainly be something you will like and will make your meal memorable.","date":"2012-12-13 15:52:00","vector":[0.1789615385,0.0,0.0,0.2083,0.0]}

Note that everything is run by the students of the culinary program at NAIT so the service isn't the best you'll find in the city, but they definitely try hard and are very helpful. It's that kind of vibe you get from a student who doesn't have experience waiting tables but is being graded on their performance so nervously tries really hard. The only downside of this restaurant is that it's simply one big room but they've done the best they can do with the decor given their space so really they deserve a pat on the back for the effort. So far I've tried the 48 Hour Chuck Steak ($12), which has creamed spinach, mushrooms, egg yolk croquette, with smoked pork fat rissole potatoes. This was really good, but what is even better is the Crispy Skin Duck Confit ($13), which has parisian gnocchi, beech mushrooms, brussels sprouts, cherry wood smoked bacon, with a mustard cream sauce. Another thing on their menu worth trying is their Braised Bison Short Rib (I only had a bit of this off a friend's plate but the bison melted in the mouth... tooo good). For desert we tried the blackberry macaroon with strawberries and gelato and even though I'm not much of a sweet tooth, this was really good.\n\nOverall, you're not going to have the best meal here that you can get in the city, but it's definitely the best meal you can get in the city for this price.","date":"2014-04-08 20:33:11","vector":[0.1663611111,0.0,0.0,-0.0416666667,0.0]}

We were also told that they did not actually have any grilled options yet as this was their soft opening, a fact that was not advertised anywhere else. Again a bit disappointed we decided to try out the ramen only to find out they also did not have any ramen yet. This was odd to hear after reading several reviews describing how delicious the ramen was...\n\nDisheartened and left with a fairly limited remaining menu, we ordered a few starters and a couple bentos. The beef done arrived with good presentation but barely enough beef to cover the rice. The \"Chef's Choice\" bento had a few pieces of fried sushi (which had no identifiable meat), two small nigiri and an adorable onigiri. Unfortunately the onigiri had nothing inside (again despite previous reviews showing filled onigiri) and we were informed they would be filled next week (??) but were still charged regular price for the bento. \n\nIn summary, a lack of upfront communication about menu item availability and unapologetic, incomplete dishes lead to an underwhelming dinner experience. An accurate soft opening menu and frank description of what is available and content of the dishes would be appreciated in the future. Also maybe don't put up signs all over the restaurant advertising your 10hr ramen broth when it isn't available yet.","date":"2018-02-11 04:04:39","vector":[0.0139052632,0.0,-0.2023,0.0,0.0]}

Thin, crispy crust with a bit of char. I sampled the Margherita, the fungi and the gorgonzola dolce and all were delicious. I received good reviews of the carne and proscuitto brie. The bars (there are two) crank out some inventive and tasty cocktails and there are good wine & beer options.\n    We will be more than happy to trek accross the bridge again very soon to enjoy the charm, hospitality and tasty eats at Tavolino soon!","date":"2017-08-10 19:03:55","vector":[0.1422058824,0.4767,0.0,0.0874857143,0.0]}

This place offers an array of appetizer categories, listing them as \"Starters\" another section as \"snacks\" and then \"sides.\"  The waitress informed us we could order however we liked from the menu, so after forgoing the temptation to have dessert for each course, we settled on a friend oyster appetizer, as well as a roasted mushroom side (which absolutely stole the show!)

I asked the waitress what is the best thing on the menu, she said the mojito sandwich. So my friend decided to get that while her husband tried to order the grilled fish sandwich. He was told with snarky remark that they don't do that on the weekend so he then had to reconsider his healthy choice options, which were limited. She then came back and said they can do it. He then asked if they had sweet potato fries, she is like no, you keep asking for healthy stuff which was her response. I got the Tex Melt sandwich, which was another choice the waitress suggested, let's put it this way none of the food was good. All the meat was over cooked, dry and flavorless. The mojito and the Tex melt had no sauce like described and the meat was not edible. The Texas toast was just white bread nothing like the real deal that is buttery and has flavor, again just toasted no butter white bread. We were so hungry and left even more hungry and thirsty from the food. The only good thing is the one meal that was taken off the bill. If you want something healthy like green beans, this place is not where you should order that either. All they did was take some green beans and nuke it with no seasoning .

If you live in the dorms, you have to have a meal plan, which sucks. It a buffet style cafeteria, but it is still not worth the price, no matter what meal plan you have. \n\nSo the Downunder Cafe, or the 'DC' opens at 7:30 and at that time they begin serving the 'Continental Breakfast.' Usually they serve fruit, waffles, toast, bagels, coffee, juice, and a couple other things. But the DC should open earlier than 7:30 for those of us who have class at 8am!!! It's really inconvenient and unhealthy to not have time to grab breakfast before class. The food they serve at this time really isn't good. It's nice to have a selection of juices to choose from, but there is seriously something wrong with every single one of the juice dispensers; the juice is always either too watery or too concentrated. The coffee is the worst coffee I've had as well! I wish they had different flavored creams to choose from, because I like flavored cream in my coffee! \n\nThe 'Regular Breakfast' is served from 8:30-10:45. Usually they have scrambled eggs, some type of sausage or bacon, and some type of hash brown or country potato dish ready to serve, which is nice. But again, none of it is very tasty! There is an omelette bar where you can order a custom omelette, but if you want an egg-white omelette, you can count on your eggs whites coming from a carton! Also, all of the omelettes that I've ever ordered were RUBBERY and BLAND! BLEGH! I wish they used more spices in all of their food. I realize that some kids have food allergies though, so maybe that's why they make food like that. \n\n'Lunch' is served from 10:45am - 2:30pm. They usually open up the sandwich bar, soup and salad bar, pizza bar, and stir fry station for this. They serve different things every day for lunch. I guess the lunch is semi-satisfying. \n\nThere is also a 'Late Lunch' between 2:30 and 5:00. I usually am only able to eat lunch during this time, which is unfortunate because they really limit what they serve during this time. For lunch meat, they have roast beef and a couple other mystery meats, which are labeled 'turkey,' 'pastrami,' and 'salami.' I say mystery meat because well, they taste so terribly that I'm not sure their labels represent what they really are. \n\nDinner starts at 5:00 and runs til 8:30. They serve something different every night, but again it's never very good. Tonight the main entree was honey glazed ham, which was acceptable. Everything on the buffet is usually cold, even though its sitting under a light. \n\nI could go on and on about the DC. Needless to say, I'm glad ill be done eating at this place as soon as I move out of the dorms at the end of the semester.","date":"2014-04-08 01:20:04","vector":[0.0270292683,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We absolutely love the area, but were surprised that we could rarely find decent pizza in this area.  We are not a fan of thin crust or Provel cheese.  That can limit your options in this area.\n\nWe found ourselves in the Shrewsbury area and looked on Yelp for a decent Pizza shop.  The first one we visited didn't have indoor seating.  We then found Stallone's Pizza.  We called ahead to ensure they did have seating.  They do.  Though nothing outdoors, they do have about 5 or 6 tables inside.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were the only ones there.  Very friendly staff. The restaurant was warm, but they had a fan running to cool things down.  Their fountain drink machine was broken, so our only drink options were bottled sodas. That was fine for us.\n\nWe ordered the 16\" pepperoni pizza.  It was delicious.  The crust was much thicker than what we've had in the area before - though I would not consider it \"thick\" or deep dish.  Just normal thickness on the crust. The cheese was delicious.  It is a mozzarella and provel mix, but very tasty.  Much better than what we've had before at Imo's and other places.\n\nOverall, the experience was very good.  We are happy that we finally found one place where we can order great pizza.  I'm sure there are others in the area, but we haven't found them yet.

Our favorite: REAL, smoked bacon, and fresh mushrooms-they run out of these from time to time due to demand and always slicing them fresh (says the owner).  My wife and I order every week!  Everyone I have had try this pizza is amazed they never had it before.  Great Family owned place tucked in a small strip mall on South Hampton.

Caters to Paleo, vegetarian and even vegan eaters.\n-Food is decent.  It is not the best, and it is not the worst.\n-Fair price for what you receive (mostly)\n-Young, lively atmosphere (this is a pro if you are also young and lively)\n-Live music on Thursdays\n-Good happy hour specials\n\nCons:\n-Service is generally slow and servers can even take a long time to come to your table when you first arrive.\n-The orders at my table have never been 100% accurate when the food came out.  On a recent visit, my friend received the wrong sushi roll TWICE.  Everyone else at the table was already finished with their food by the time hers finally arrived.  They should have comped her sushi roll or given her a drink for free in the mean time, but they did not.  At least they apologized.\n-Depending on the time of night and whether not it is a weekend, it can be really loud up in there, but I guess that is to be expected on South Howard.\n\nOverall, this place is a decent go-to spot for Thursday happy hour or if you want to grab something convenient before a night out in SoHo.

First off - please get air-conditioning or fix the air-conditioning you have. The place had to be 30 above inside - very uncomfortable. Secondly, servers please pay attention to your customers. It took me forever to get one of their attention and to order. I ordered a bellini, a mini hamburger, and 10 lemon pepper wings. You would think my drink would come first? Nope. My food came and they mixed up my wings with my friend's wings - easy to solve. I mentioned to the server about my drink because I'm certain she forgot. He doesn't even acknowledge I spoke to him and walked away. I have a really loud voice. Finally after I have eaten my burger and some of my wings, my drink comes. \n\nThe good news is that the bellini was very good as were the wings. The mini burger tasted like those fake patties you would get at a free BBQ. Another good thing is that with a drink the wings were 35 cents. The mini burgers and tacos are $2 Monday nights as well. My whole bill came out close to $14 which is a good deal. Then I wanted to order more wings. And couldn't get the attention of the server again. I guess an open menu doesn't mean you are interested in ordering more food. So I thought, \"Screw it! This place doesn't deserve more of my money any way!\". \n\nThen came the bill. I was with a group of people and one of the guys with us was given the wrong bill and had to try and track down our server and get it fixed.

I'm on my way back to the states, so I thought I'd write a few reviews of some of the places we'd visited. \n\nTo be frank, the service here sucked.\n\n  We came in around midnight after fringing, and walked up to the bar. We were looking for a table, and a waitress who was talking to some people seated at the bar (turns out they were all friends with each other) showed us to a booth. It was just two of us, and we were seated behind five noisy chicks. It's a bar so of course we didn't care much. Our waitress drops menus off at our table and actually goes to chat with the five noisy chicks behind us. They were clearly personal friends with each other, but we didn't care much. \n\n  She came up to us five minutes later to take our order. We started naming off a couple bulldogs and hi-balls. We had about 4-5 drinks in mind for the both of us to share. She asked us if it was all for just the two of us, to which we replied yes, and then says that we have to order each drink separately because \"that's too much alcohol in front you.\" \n  ????\n   I'm from the states, and that's not a policy anywhere. My friend is from Edmonton, and she had never heard of such a policy either.  We're at fucking bar, where there's an abundance of alcohol, with belligerent women screaming with laughter behind us, as well as a drunk old man who's dressed like he's 60 years younger than he looks, and you're worried about us? Oh wait, I forgot that the women are your friends, I'm sorry. \n\n  Anyway, we continue to order our drinks one by one, and she leaves us for 15 minute intervals between each drink, and every time she had come up to us, she gave us an attitude and it seemed like we were taking away from here time with her friends. At one point, the drunk old guy starts walking around and floating around at the bar, talking to the younger crowd, making them uncomfortable and whatnot. He wound up standing at the bar in front of a stool one chick was sitting in, but she had gotten up. She was standing near our booth, watching him, and contemplating with our waitress if she should kick him out. She then turned around to us and asked how everything was, and if there was anything else she could get us. \n  We were surprised to find out that she was actually the manager of the place. She was wearing a white shirt and a mini skirt and the only thing that gave her away as an employee was a walkie-talkie or something sticking out of her pocket. I mean, she was just sitting at the bar talking to the big group of friends. She was easy on the eyes, but she could at least identify herself as a manager with a name tag or something. Our waitress didn't have a name tag either, or I'd be calling her out on here, no joke. \n\n  All in all, it was ridiculous that it was one big gathering of \"besties\" and we felt unwelcome. We didn't eat any of the food cuz it looked terrible at the booth behind us.","date":"2013-08-26 01:43:48","vector":[0.0,0.2756166667,0.0,-0.0125526316,0.0]}

The icing is where things go really crazy - they basically take an ice cream scoop full of frosting and plop it on top of the cupcake. I wouldn't have minded that, but the frosting itself isn't good tasting - overly sweet, tastes like sweetened crisco, and the chocolate frosting didn't even taste like chocolate. I don't think it's a huge deal to charge $3 for a cupcake - I think it's ridiculous to charge $3 for bad-tasting cupcakes.

We arrived first and were seated at a booth. While walking in I noticed a large lettuce leaf on the floor. No one ever picked it up. our waitress walked over the lettuce leaf multiple times and never got a bus boy to clean it up nor did she bend down to get it.  As we sat down we were given some bread and olive oil to enjoy. The olive Oil mix had way too much cheese and red pepper flakes in the oil to really enjoy the flavor of the olive oil. it was sad that this occurred but what was even more sad is that the plates we were given were chipped.   I could overlook the chipped plates but when i opened my silverware my fork had dried food bits on it.  So I asked for another set and with no apologies I got fresh silverware.\n\nThroughout the evening we had minor issues with the food. Mostly it was because of the amount of red pepper flakes in the food.  For example, we had ordered Fried Calamari as an appetizer, Shrimp & Scallop Grand Marnier and Chilean Sea Bass Moldano, The Fried Calamari and the Chilean Sea bass like the olive oil,  had too much red pepper flakes. I myself do not eat a lot of spicy food but my boyfriend who lives on kemchie even commented on the crazy amount of pepper flakes. \n\nAll in all, the only thing I really enjoyed about the meal was the calamari. My dinner was okay but again they went overboard with the garnishments in the dish. The dish just had way too many sun dried tomatoes in it. They were hard and hard to chew. I will agree with other reviewers that yes they do give out large portions but if it's not cooked well or seasoned well, then what's the point.  I took my leftovers home and ended up throwing it away after I picked through the shrimp and scallops.  I don't believe I would ever go back to this establishment.  Save your money and eat  at another establishment.","date":"2012-02-08 15:48:48","vector":[0.1217205882,0.0,0.0,-0.0328888889,0.0]}

Since the first time I ordered from them almost 2 years ago, I've been in charge of the weekly group lunch for my work and they all want Papa Johns. Unfortunately, it has to come from this Papa Johns because we are on their delivery route. I don't even know where to start with how awful of a business this is and how much I want to stop giving them our money. \n\nI've been running the group lunch for a year now. I literally put in the same order every week, ask for it to get to us at the same time, and on the same day. They have been on time maybe twice. They are 20 or more minutes late EVERY TIME even though I call ahead the day before to tell them my order. If I were you, I would expect them to be late, even if you give them a full day's notice, so give them a delivery time earlier than expected.\n\nAlso, often it takes me 15 minutes to put in an order because they can't remember me, or the guy on the phone is confused and has to ask someone questions (the same questions every week, mind you). Rarely, I get someone who actually knows what they're doing and I can get done with the call in 5 minutes. Rarely.\n\nLast night I had pizza from another Papa Johns and let me tell you, it blew this Papa Johns out of the water. I can't understand how something that should have the same recipe can taste so different between two locations (we ordered from one near Webster Groves). Just another example of how awful this Papa Johns is.\n\nNot to mention the headache they caused me last week. I called in the day before, put my regular order at my regular time for the regular day. Then the day they were supposed to be delivering my pizza, they are running 15 minutes late (no surprise there) so I do my ritualistic phone call to see if they are on their way (sometimes they dont actually leave the store until 20 minutes after the pizza SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE). When I call, they tell me the order was put in for another day! The earliest they could get pizza to me would be in another hour and a half, which is a half hour after the meeting I needed pizza for in the first place ends. I basically get a \"sorry, nothing we can do\" and that's it. Great customer service, Papa Johns (sarcasm). I ended up wasting an hour of my work day driving to Little Caesars and getting pizza that tastes about the same for half the price. Smh!\n\nThe only good thing I can (kind of) say about this place is that their drivers are always nice. But about a quarter of the time they forget the plates and napkins that I ask for. And 99.9% of the time they are late.\n\nSo if you don't want anything on time along with average tasting, overpriced, and sometimes nonexistent pizza, order from this Papa Johns. If you want to support a business that's actually run decently, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.","date":"2014-10-30 18:35:32","vector":[-0.00449375,0.4215,0.17,-0.069475,0.0]}

I didn't want to cook, my back hurt, and my feet were not collaborating. So I drove to Woodlawn Avenue where we had been amazingly surprised by very decent food at Steak 'n' Shake, both burger and shake. But I didn't have coupons for them this time. A coupon is supposed to entice you to try a place. And Hardee's beckoned with their 1\/3 lb. cheeseburger (more like a free sliding from mayonnaise greased bun puck of meat, which was microwaved before placement in already mentioned bun. French fries were OK in comparison; they had a degree of moistness inside their crispy exterior, which could not be said for the so called 1\/3 lb. puck of congealed beef. I made the mistake of ordering two milk shakes without whipped cream. I saw the young man behind the counter scoop the ice cream. How bad could it be? After being asked which one took the whipped cream, I received what looked like strange chemically induced pink color passing as strawberry, the chocolate looked normal. They were both thin shakes. One would think for shakes priced at $3.19 that they would slightly thick. Not so. The whole thing came to $18.00 + including tax for two 1\/3 lb. burgers, 2 small fries, and 2 awful, melted down shakes. And all this bounty made possible with a coupon!\nNow the service: three people working. (1) one took my order (2) another slopped the food in the hot area and (3) the manager hid in the office and came out to do something to the cash register and promptly disappeared. The whole transaction took 25 minutes. I was the only one in the store, and there was one car in the pickup window. \nWhy is Hardee's still in business? They are really, really bad in food and exacrable in service. It's like going to a slow motion McDonald's, with even, if that's possible, worse food. It is no secret to me anymore why I never see any cars or customers at these bad food and inferior service restaurants. It can't be marketing 'cuz we all know, marketin' ain't cookin' nor servin'.

The most unique of it's kind come Lent. The gym is so crowded & this place is packed in well over fire code, but the operation runs like a well oiled machine.\n\n I came with a group of veterans. For $6 more per entree you can submit an online order check in, and escape the horror of a line that wraps around the antiquated gymnasium like a tornado. With the amount of money being shelled out on booze & Mexican fare, you'd think the church would be updated to look like the Taj Majal. \n\nSt. Louisans far and wide should come here at least once. It's essentially a local bucket list type experience. Food wise I'd recommend the tamales, chile rilleno, and a la carte chips & pico. The salmon is good, but be cognizant of eating any bones as its served as the full fish. The line starts to fizzle out past 7:30, but note that you may have limited options due to certain items running out.

The stories of long lines just wasn't worth the hassle to me, and the fish fry season goes by so fast! They should just make it a year round thing, but I guess they have to follow some sort of biblical teachings which results in this event only occurring 4:30-8pm on Fridays during Lent (approximately six Fridays between Mardi Gras and Easter).  I highly recommend going if you get a chance! \n\nIt is true about the long line that stretches all the way around the small gymnasium and out the door into the parking lot.  When I arrived around 4:30pm, people were lined out the door.  I've been told that it shortens towards the end of the evening, but you run the risk of some items being sold out.  As I slowly entered the gym, anticipation grew with a feeling a sensory overload.  The gym was packed with tables and people were moving every-which-way in a sort of organized chaos.  As we moved along in the line, we passed various tables selling everything from t-shirts to Mexican beer to church tours.  St. Cecilia's has really turned this into an impressive money making machine.  I'd estimate the line to be two beers long once I got inside, but the people watching makes it enjoyable.  \n\nOnce you get to the front of the line, you place your order and they give you a number to display on your table.  Thankfully they bring the food out to you; otherwise it would end up on the floor as you try to find an open table.  Menu options include two kinds of fish: jack salmon and cod fillet.  The jack salmon, served with the bones in it, is the better option over the cod fillet which is just a frozen square fish patty.  Honestly, I recommend skipping the fish and ordering the Mexican food.  The chile relleno, stuffed with cheese and smothered in a red sauce, was delicious.  The fried quesadilla was also tasty, but the puffed shell lacking in filling.  I was surprised to see the quesadilla deep fried, which is common in Mexico, but rare here in the United States.  Side items included options of mac & cheese, French fries, cole slaw, rice and refried beans.  They also sold tortilla chips and pico de gallo at one of the tables in the line.  Overall, I found the Mexican food to be very authentic and delicious.  Just when I thought I couldn't eat anymore, I spotted kids pushing around tamale carts and dessert carts.

If you are coming for fast food, don't even think about it unless you order on their website ($6 premium). But if you are coming for the experience and you are prepared for 2+ hours of delay without reaching a dangerous \"hangry\" state, then you should absolutely visit at least once. Grab a few friends and, as John mentioned below, it will be a night to remember. \n\nWe arrived right around 5 (early enough I had thought) but the line was already out the parking lot long. Luckily it was a warmish 60 degrees and we passed the time with beer, margaritas, and tamales. There are separate and much shorter lines to buy these items so either take turns standing in the food line with a friend or make friends with the people behind you so you can leave to get snacks\/drinks. The tamales were delicious (was it fish or cheese inside? None of us could figure it out). The gymnasium was packed with diners and entertainers (adorable children in colorful Mexican dresses and some dressed up adult dancers too). After ordering, we waited over an hour for the food while chatting and drinking beers. By the time our fried jack salmon (whole fish), chile rellenos, and sides had arrived, everything was barely lukewarm, which was a real pity as the fish was tasty (needed some seasoning\/pepper) and the chile rellenos were delicious even cold so I could only imagine how much better everything would be hot. I also loved the mango sponge cake from the dessert table. \n\nI think we all need to remember this is an event put on by church members and volunteers. There are certainly things they can improve but these are not professional caterers (order runners are teenagers who were really trying and a few looked overwhelmed). If the church wants to improve the efficiency of the whole process, they should talk to the folks at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in Central West End. We visit St. Nicholas' Greek Fest every year. They manage to meet the demand of just as big a crowd with much faster turnaround. I think the key is to give diners food as soon as they pay (instead of delivering later). Fish has to be fried in batches but by the time we paid there were piles of everything in trays behind the cashier's desk. If they had people serve the food right there, I imagine it could cut down on the wait time significantly. \n\nTips:\n1. Arrive before 5 PM or plan on spending at least 2.5 hours for the whole experience\n2. Bring cash - much faster order line\n3. Margaritas are made with generic mix - so if you wanted anything more \"special\" or do not like your margaritas too sweet, you may want to stick to the beer","date":"2016-03-12 17:08:47","vector":[0.0842227273,0.2500714286,0.0,0.09343,0.0]}

What was even sadder is that the new owners and their daughters seemed very attentive and concerned but have just missed the mark SOOO much.

Committed to using oft-forgotten ingredients, all locally-sourced, chef Adam Diltz adds his own flair into traditional dishes like turtle soup.\n\nThe small house opens directly into the kitchen, with the dining room and a full garden toward the back. The dining space takes cues from a Victoria living room, channeling white-clothed tables and chic, comfortable grey cushioned seating. Early-American landscape paintings and fauna watercolors decorated the muted grey walls. The porcelain China mirrors the artwork flora, and the ceiling is covering with a material resembling tree bark. Mid-century acoustic music plays unobtrusively in the background.\n\nMy partner and I arrived early Friday afternoon eager to explore the adventurous menu. We decided upon the Kensington Snapper (Turtle) Soup, the frog leg appetizer special, the Potato Rolls, and the venison top roast family-style entree special. As we finished up our order, chef Adam Diltz took a moment to make his rounds about the tables. Affable and easygoing, chef Diltz's appearance didn't feel forced -- he gave us a rundown of some of his favorite menu items and talked a bit about his background in PA. I was mildly surprised throughout our meal by how relatively empty the restaurant was. Only a handful of other 2-person parties decided on Elwood for dinner, even as we approached prime time on Friday night.\n\nBefore beginning our meal, an amuse-bouche of venison scrapple, topped with harissa and spruce jam, was served on a staghorn. With a crispy exterior and a soft, rich interior, the zingy bite was a fitting homage to PA Dutch classic. Within minutes, our appetizers were brought out. The snapper soup was served in a traditional soup bowl, with sides of hard-boiled egg and sherry vinegar The soup itself had a thick, stewy consistency, and the generous helping of turtle was reminiscent of pulled pork. The broth transformed to sweet-and-sour notes with the addition of the sherry, followed by a lingering spice. The potato rolls were fluffy and coated with caramelized fall honey (made by chef Diltz's wife's personal beehive), complemented by salted pork lard. Moving on, the frog legs were coated in cattail pollen and grilled, served above a mound of frog feet and a floral-garlic broth. Although each leg was only two bites, each contained an entree worth of flavor; that being said, the chewy, fishy frog feet and the one-dimensional broth both fell flat.\n\nFor each family-style entree, the ma\u00eetre d showed the final product to the table before it was carved -- when he brought our venison out, the smokey aroma turned heads from tables around the room, as other patrons regretted not ordering it themselves. The venison was hickory-smoked and served medium-rare, glazed in syrup, and drizzled with a salty-savory red-wine pan sauce. Seasonal accompaniments to balance out the gamey plate of meat included pickled turnips and apples, sauerkraut, garlic stem, apple butter, fluffy buttery mashed potatoes, and a roasted squash medley.\n\nThe hearty meal left us barely able to move, much less make room for dessert. Our total worked out to $130 after tax and tip; surprisingly fair considering the sheer size of each plate. Each dish was net hit, and with a seasonal menu, I'm excited to try out Elwood again once Diltz has a bevy of new ingredients.","date":"2019-10-21 23:56:08","vector":[0.111285,-0.3818,0.41915,0.0783833333,0.0]}

In CA, drinks can be upwards of $4+ dollars for simple lattes with no dairy alternatives, so I always appreciate a quality drink with a great price. :) \n\nIn addition, it's close to a bunch of cool spots and a short walk to the French Quarter and the river or Harrah's.

I actually think the concept of having a membership to a restaurant is a little weird, but apparently they have enough higher up clientele to support the biz.\n\nKate B., Jason, and I came here on Saturday evening around 10:30pm. It was pretty hoppin' in the place. Kate told us prior to entering she had an expired membership and she said that once we would enter, she was going to renew. Since Jason and I have never been, it kind of felt like we were getting the RSVP treatment. In order to get in -- know someone. Cool!\n\nAt our table, our server gave us our menus. I noticed that it had 'Week if February 21\". I They change the menu up weekly I assume. Everything looked pretty basic in my opinion with fine dining prices. A menu item would be some fancy chicken dish but then have sides that sounded simple like Yukon gold mashed potatoes and Granny Apple.....? I guess they didn't want to add any adjectives with the sides....\n\nKate ordered something off the menu that seemed to be described more as a dessert item than an appetizer. All I remember about it is it had a french donut and a cream puree that was made from duck liver. Not something I would order, but after sampling it, it was not that bad. She indulged. For $14, that seemed a bit steep for what she got on the plate.\n\nJason ordered some fries that came with their in-house made ketchup. Kate vocalized she was not a fan of it. Jason and I didn't care for it either. It had a bit of a kick to it as far as spice goes and had a pasty texture.\n\nI simply ordered a \"bartender creation\". I overall liked what they had made me. It was straight up booze though. No mixers what so ever. It was subtle but did give me a little buzz.\n\nAmbiance is nice. Staff are friendly, and it was a nice atmosphere with an awesome bathroom according to Jason.\n\nI think I should come here for dinner. I realize coming here for 1 drink is not going to give me the full on experience. For now, I give it 3 stars. I do want to see what they have to offer next time I get to have the opportunity to come here. Believe me when I say, I am not going to come here on my own dime. A 1 month $15 membership for a restaurant? I can save that for the valet or the meters that are outside the place.","date":"2012-03-02 05:15:31","vector":[0.02408,0.04939,0.0,0.1082357143,0.0]}

The food was fabulous, but for me the restaurant is hampered by its membership model.\n\nThe Food:  We started with the Truffled Tatter Tots, which were delicious.  My wife had 2 of the \"Cherry Cherry\" cocktails, which I sampled and were delightful.   I had the Bone in Wild Boar, which came with sweet potatoes and Thai Eggplant, and every bit of it was wonderful.  My wife had the Pepper Encrusted Strip Steak, and the sauce, steak and accompanying potatoes were awesome.  Overall, I thought the meal was as good as any I have had in Saint Louis.\n\nThe membership model: I just don't get it.   Its not that $15\/month is that much, but I just don't want to have an ongoing billing relationship with a restaurant.  I don't want to have to remember to cancel it if we stop going, I don't want to feel obligated to go because of the ongoing membership fee.   Its like owning a vacation house - once you do you feel obligated to go there, and it ruins the experience.  I think we would go here repeatedly were it not for the membership fee, but the membership fee is just too much of a hassle.   The restaurant was very lightly attended on a Tuesday night.   Maybe they have a ton of people paying them $15\/month, but it sure seemed unsustainable when we were there.\n\nI hope that the chef\/team behind this restaurant will try another, non-membership effort elsewhere in Saint Louis.  I think they would get a lot of repeat business without the weird membership requirement.  I think if they had a restaurant out west, near Olive and Oak or Tavern, they would be very competitive with either.","date":"2017-09-20 21:50:54","vector":[0.1993333333,0.0,0.0,-0.0099,0.0]}

They feature a plethora of local comfort foods such as baked chicken, fried chicken, baked fish, baked salmon, fried fish, meatloaf, stuffed bell peppers, lasagna and a variety of vegetables.  My favorite is the baked chicken, as the pieces are HUGE.  I always get the steamed veggies which consist of a blend of cabbage, broccoli and carrots.  However, I've had the fried fish, the salmon and the gumbo and have never been disappointed.  I don't know her name, but there is a wonderfully nice hispanic lady who always works the hot line and enthusiastically greets her regular customers.  \n\nThe right side of the deli is for sandwiches.  Their hot sausage po-boy is my favorite in the city.  Yeah you heard me right when I said that my favorite hot sausage po-boy comes from a deli in a mall's food court.

I felt bad for the regular Insomnia location in the front. We did not see a single person go in while we waited. I guess they do well with delivery.\n\nThe atmosphere of this place is definitely cool - from the bookshelf door to the neon theme inside the CookieLab. I will direct you to my photos but they really don't do it justice. It is worth it check this place out just to see what they've done with the place.\n\nYou're going to want to check out the menu beforehand. It was so overwhelming - they will let you design you own cookie dough and bake the cookies while you wait (45ish min). They also have a seemingly endless list of cookie topping to choose from. We were so overwhelmed that we ended up getting a half dozen of the pre-designed cookies (pictured).\n\nMy favorite was the \"Galaxy\", which is a Double Chocolate Cookie with purple icing, white chocolate chips and sprinkles. Honestly, I think the pre-designed cookies are mediocre concoctions. It might be a better idea to get the usual Insomnia cookies you like and add icing\/toppings.\n\nThis place gets 4 stars for effort and the cool atmosphere. However, I will say that it felt a little *awkward* in there. Very quiet and not super clear where you order, where you wait, and whether or not someone will come clean the crumbs from the people before you.\n\nI don't know that I will go back but YOU should definitely make the trip. Just try to make it during the day not on the weekend.","date":"2021-08-20 17:40:20","vector":[0.125575,0.39995,0.0,0.0909142857,0.0]}

The major highlight of my experience was the zoo of people that accumulated as several of the bottlenecks that most chains have worked out were very apparent. Firehouse elected to use only one person at the register (who seemed inseparable with her phone) and also chose a myriad of inexperienced people who blankly stared into the distance, hoping the clock would tick faster. I cannot blame those who do not enjoy sandwich making and I will note that there was a young lady with glasses who took extreme pride in her work and was definitely the difference maker in Firehouse getting double the stars they deserve.

I thought it was me being crazy. Waiting for our to go food, we sat at the bar and he starts muttering and saying threats about belting me and stabbing in the stomach. He was like 70 but looked like he was either employed there or associated in some way because he moved through the back service door to throw away his own beer bottle and went into a the kitchen a couple times without being accosted by the staff. A nice yat lady called attention to his aggression which kind of shook us out of trying to block him out and made us more aware that other people were also uncomfortable and it wasn't just us. Jorge made eye contact, crazy eyes, whatever this guy was threatening he meant it. Without getting our food yet, we ditched the bar area and moved towards the car. I recognized my body's physical response to the situation as being very similar to the time my ex and I were jumped back in Bangor, Maine. GTFO. After moving the car to a different parking lot, he went back in to express his concern to management. They seemed kind of toothless in the matter and whomever Jorge spoke to had an intense emotional response to his threat of calling the police on him (atypical of bartender\/regular relationships as far as I know. makes me think it was someone related to or close to her personally).

In fact, I'd say it's easily our favorite place to stop when we're on a mission for a treat. The wide variety of both yogurt flavors and toppings makes it easy for every to find just the right combination to please their sweet tooth.  So it's probably easy to figure out that we were thrilled to see one coming to the North Valleys. \n\nWe've visited all of the Yogurt Beach locations at least once over the years and have found them to all to be quite consistent in delivering what we've come to expect from the business. Happily, I can say after a few visits to what will from now on be considered \"our Yogurt Beach\" that the bar continues to be set high.\n\nStaff is very friendly and quick to offer samples, as well as the basic run-down to newbies. The place is spotless...spills and drips of toppings are cleaned up so quickly you might think you imagined them. Items are consistently well-stocked and fresh.\n\nFor me, there is one tiny \"not quite 5 stars\" issue with this location, and that is seating. They are sharing space with the new Longboards Pizza. Within the Yogurt Beach section, there is just one table. It's bar - height which I personally can't do thanks to a back injury. But more than that, every time we've visited its already been full anyway. I suspect the idea is that folks can grab a table in the pizza side. This has worked fine when we've made a mid-afternoon treat stop, but around meal times we've found it difficult to get a spot over there. They do have an incredible patio that helps solve the issue in nice weather.\n\nOverall, that certainly not going to deter us, though.

In order to really see the Ben Franklin bridge, being outside would be the best.\n\nOur waitress was really really slow. We order around 845ish and we did not leave until 11pm.  She offered us bread and butter and that took forever. I thought with the length it took for the bread\/butter to come out that they were hand churning the butter back there. When it did come out, she said it was European butter. Let's just say there was nothing special about the butter. The food itself was decent, really nothing mind blowing. Our table ordered steak and duck as an entree. My steak was fine and I felt the duck could have been cooked more. The skin would have been better if crispier and the fat more rendered. We ordered a few apps, everyone an entree, and a few desserts. No one at the table was particularly wowed by any of the dishes we got. \n \nAlso, we came on a Friday night and outside there was a live band and they were extremely entertaining and sang very well. \n\nOverall the drinks were OK, the service was a bit lacking, and the food wasn't all that memorable.

It has been a venue and an art gallery with an industrial vibe, pretty much underneath the Ben Franklin Bridge, for as long as I can remember. It is a pretty cool place looking from the outside and has been put to good use for an old utility building. So once it was turned into a restaurant I thought, this is perfect! Like other repurposed buildings in the city, this will be a cool, hip place that got a top tier chef to create a culinary\/cultural home run like the FIshtown La Colombe, Jerry's in Northern Liberties, or Frankfort Hall off of Girard Ave. \n\nWow, was I wrong.....at least for part of that assumption\/hope.\n\nThe building and general vibe is as cool as I expected. Old Industrial feel and chic clean design. Really a place you would expect to be filled by young professional severy night, even if the location is a little off the beaten chill-spot path. But what you actually see is very different. My girlfriend and I were the only ones under 55 there and the place was largely empty at 7:30pm, what I consider prime to late dinner time. Since the place looked rather expensive to develop, we expected a lively, cool wait staff. What we got was a waitress that actually talked down on the food, calling the salads \"small piles\" and admitting all the portions were pretty small, which they defiantly were. With the supposed French inspired menu you would expect good french food with a twist. As the only appetizing options on the menu, the collard green tasting green beans were mediocre, the rabbit pasta was tasty but way too small, and the burger (a weird addition to a \"French\" menu and probably an attempt to keep up with the gastropub trends) was hilariously forgettable according to my girlfriend. The pumpkin based beer I had and the ros\u00e9 my girlfriend got tasted like mild pumpkin water and bad zinfandel respectively. Waste. Of. Money.\n\nAlso something very important was an article from a Philly based magazine calling the Pho here the best in the city. LIES! The Pho was the main culinary motivation to come here. But for $10 you get a child's size bowl of broth, one small strip of beef, and an underwhelming dumpling, not to forget a predetermined (small) amount of sriracha and hoisin sauce. So. Weak. Even though the bowl was small, the sauces made little to no difference to the taste. Bad. Go to Pho 75 and get MUCH more and better Pho for $6.75. \n\nOverall this place is not good. The small portions for inflated prices that they hope are justified by the cool atmosphere, fall on their face and are outdone by almost any place in the city not named Taco Bell or McDonalds. The best part of the night was using UberX during their free weekend promotion....and even that was a waste since we live pretty close to the restaurant. The only caveat to the restaurant is that they are relatively new, so things could change, but I doubt they will...and I will not attempt to find out.","date":"2014-10-27 14:08:15","vector":[0.074165,0.1806,-0.11315,0.1551761905,-0.2732]}

The lady taking my order would cut me off while I was asking for my drink before I was able to specify milk and other variations - I'm one of those people I know.  She sounded exasperated by my order and in a bad mood so I left it and said thank you after finally getting my drink ordered.  Drove up to pay and had the card reader shoved in my face. Then someone else brings my drink, the wrong size, and disappears before I can say anything.  I get someone's attention, apologize and mention I may have gotten the wrong drink, she then remakes the drink and had a printout of my order.  Before she gives me the new drink she shows me the printout, indicates that I had just lied, and then shoves the drink into my car.  Not wanting to argue, I smiled, said thank you, and drove off.  I did not want to be anywhere near the negativity the staff were exuding. \n\nNeedless to say, human error occurs and I would have been fine keeping the small if that's what I had paid for.

It's still a three-star, but my first impressions were not my lasting impressions. \n\nThis north-end restaurant is situated in a busy hub off St. Albert Trail and shares mega-mall space with Cineplex Odeon, Moxie's, Tony Roma's, Subway, Booster Juice and over a dozen other businesses. \n\nI moved to the north end last year, and although I wasn't overly thrilled with Lazia the first time I visited, my sweetie and I have returned many times when date night keeps us in our neck of the woods. \n\nI have come to feel quite cozy and at home in this restaurant-cum-nightclub, with its plush, oval booths, soothing mahogany accents, crimson walls, warm, mindfully placed pot-lighting and, last but not least, its raucous music and conversation that's so steady on a Saturday night that it fades into ambient white noise as we become part of the vibe.\n\nYou MUST start with \"the only way to gyoza\" - savoury pork dumplings with a ponzu dipping sauce. I'm not exactly sure what ponzu is, but I know it contains soy sauce and I know it is absolutely addictive! \n\nFor drinks, I can go for a cold Keith's, a Bellini, a glass of vino or a rye & diet, depending on my mood. After you've been to gyoza, you can't go wrong with the Pad Thai, although it's a bit overpriced for a plate of pasta, at $15.95 -  but well worth it. \n\nThis place gets a lot of weekend pre-movie traffic - so expect a small line if you want to be seated in the restaurant. We always sit in the lounge as we're more appy and cocktail people than fine diners. On the casual side, you can walk right in and seat your selves. When it's busy, you may wait a couple of minutes for a waitress to notice you, but otherwise service is quite prompt. \n\nI'm glad I gave you another try, Lazia. While you are not gourmet, you do not disappoint.","date":"2010-08-22 04:24:34","vector":[-0.0503545455,0.10115,0.296,0.0867055556,0.0]}

Steve is a \"real\" S. La. guy - from Oakdale, La. where he still generously performs with his bands for friends, family and other locals pretty often.  Steve has always been a gifted guitarist, and it isn't hard to find him booked to play these days (look for Hollyrock or The Ice Man Special - both are playing in Oakdale on Thanksgiving eve, 2016).  Steve's shop, International Vintage Guitars, has inventoried many rare, hard to find, and highly desirable guitars (and amplifiers, effects, etc.) for decades.  He must be some kind of wizard to find them, but he keeps digging up incredible guitars (check his FB page where he occasionally posts new and exciting instruments: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/stephen.staples.505).  Steve is a virtual walking encyclopedia of knowledge on guitars, equipment and the music of our generation (and a couple of prior generations), and it is always fun to hear what gem will share next.  IVG's customer list is a virtual who's who of guitar greats from around the world, and regular folks can get the same great service at IVG (and not all of the guitars for sale have incomprehensible price tags).  I love New Orleans and all of its music, food, and culture, but even if I didn't it would be worth the trip just to go to International Vintage Guitars and visit with Steve Staples.

We were so excited to try a new Middle Eastern place in SB (where variety is lacking) and this is not even a bad example of Middle Eastern food, because there is nothing about it to justify calling it Middle Eastern, or food.  The pita, which is the staple of the region)  was store bought, flat, flavorless, and cold.  The \"shwarma,\" was just over cooked chicken (not from the rotisserie) and it was slathered in some mayo, which has nothing whatever to do with the cuisine either.  Then there's the falafel:  was it falafel?  I am not sure, as it felt and taste more like deeply over fried paper. Oh, and I haven't mentioned the lack of flavor and service?  How about the lack of garnishes, and salads that are the staple of all dishes in a fresh Middle Eastern diet?  Just awful in every way.  I have been in Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Israel, Algeria, and of course all over the EU and England, where there is amazing Mid East food.  Don't be fooled into thinking this represents our culture of welcoming and sharing, or abundance of healthy flavorful eats, just because it's Santa Barbara and there is only the slightly better Zaytoon to compare.\n\nIt's a dark hole, no music, not lights, no wait staff to greet anyone.

In the past year and a half the food and service has been going downhill. The staff that picks up the dishes always seems to have an angry look on their faces and never even say Hi. Many of the trays of food had very little in them and it seemed they weren`t going to replace them until the last minute. We never get the mac & cheese...it`s horrible! The fried chicken is pretty good, but we had to wait for over an hour for them to replace those last 3 dried out pieces. We stayed for awhile just to see if they would replace some trays. No, we don`t normally hang out at buffets. We just got through fishing with a group of friends and had bragged to them that the food would be pretty good at the New Taste. I feel like we let our friends down in a big way. They use to serve peach cobbler, but that has been replaced with some cooked down apple stuff. Not very good at all, but I`m assuming it is cheaper to serve. There are hardly any salad dressing choices...well, they have 3! YeePee  The dessert choices are a joke. Cookies, a few ice cream choices, a couple of coffee cakes cut into bite size pieces. The vanilla and chocolate pudding taste like it came out of a can. They can call me and tell me if I`m wrong about that, but I`m not. The orange jello with marshmallows is usually a favorite of mine, but the last couple of times it has been watery. The barbecue pork ribs barely had any sauce on them and the beef back ribs were dry as dust. They need to add more vegetable varieties and add taste to the dishes they already serve. There was no fish at all when we were there, but they finally brought some shrimp out when we were preparing to leave. Bring back the cobblers, add some real cakes, a variety of vegetables (cabbage, okra, pinto beans, peas and carrots, etc,) I`ll pay more if the food is worth it. A lot of the foods were not marked and not even the 3 salad dressings they did have...the letters had wore off. How Sad! There is no pride in food quality or service. I did complain to the cashier up front on our way out. She was defensive and could have cared less. I had to ask her 4 times for a phone number so I could call and speak to someone in charge. They most certainly are not the nice buffet we started coming to over 5 years ago and I did tell the cashier that we won`t be back!

There is also a salad bar in the back. And don't forget to ask for a change of grill top to ensure your food does not taste burnt. The price is affordable depending if you go for lunch or dinner ranging from 10-20 per person including tax and tip. \n\nThe reason I only recommend the BBQ and hotpot is because everything else sucks or is just average.

Not so from Mr. Wings!  When we got it for the first time, we were extremely impressed.  The crust was crispy, the sauce was tasty, and there was plenty of cheese and toppings.  For pizza of this style, it's one of the best I've had in this city (different from \"gourmet\" pizza, I'd say it's great for basic pizzeria style pizza).\n\nThe wings have always been great too.  I've seen a few reviews commenting on how small the wings are, but I don't really see the problem.  We generally get the boneless wings though, which are considerably larger.  My favorite sauces are the cajun (which is a dry-rub with accompanying dipping sauce) and the honey BBQ.  We had guests in from out of town, and they LOVED the honey BBQ sauce.  It's a unique sauce, quite unlike other generic honey BBQ sauces I've had at other wing places.\n\nIn terms of sides, they have a lot of options, but I've only tried the cheese bacon fries and the caesar fries.  The cheese bacon fries are exactly what they sound like: cheese wiz, bacon bits and fries.  Pretty solid!  The caesar fries were really interesting, covered with caesar salad dressing and parmesan cheese.  \n\nIf I had one complaint, it would be that I'd prefer more carrots over celery as the veggie accompaniment to wings.  I hate celery, but love blue cheese (theirs is delightfully chunky), and the carrots are a nice touch.  Last time we ordered, they forgot the carrots, but that's a minor complaint.  I'll just specify extra carrots next time.\n\nOverall, they are a solid wing and pizza option.","date":"2014-01-26 19:53:16","vector":[0.1361852941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

HORRIBLE experience. \n\nWe expected the price (around $20 per person). But the food, not only in quality, but their selection? For that price, I couldn't believe it! First off, there was only ONE type of meat to choose from, which was prime rib. I tried a piece, and it tasted as if it had been sitting around all day. Much like most of their food tasted. Everything that I tried that evening tasted like it had been sitting around, and it was all very dry, and tasteless. The desserts looked fabulous. The cookies? Hard as a rock. The pineapple upside down cake? Rubbery. The chocolate mousse? Yeah, that was just jello pudding out of a container. The ONLY good thing on their \"buffet\" was the mashed potatoes, and you had to scoop from the bottom of the pan, so that you didn't get all the dried up potato from the top. \n\nI was disgusted not only by the food, but they had the audacity to charge TWENTY dollars for it! NEVER again, and I highly recommend that NO one visit their establishment. We went to Golden Corral the next night, and had much better food there!\n\nOh, and something that kinda pissed our group off. They had a sign near the entrance that read \"Like us on Facebook, and receive a free buffet!\" A bit misleading. You have to sign up for one of their casino cards (which, that's free, so no biggie). But you cannot sign up for the promotion from your smart phone (either with iPhone or Android, we tried both), so you had to do it on your computer, and come back for the free buffet. I wouldn't even eat there for free, after our experience, so needless to say, we did NOT sign up when we got to a computer.\n\nThe only good thing?

If you're in the area, it's definitely something to try. It was very busy for a weekday, so that's a good sign, right?","date":"2019-01-22 21:28:02","vector":[0.0851,0.0,0.0,0.185,0.0]}

We came here on Friday for lunch.  Albeit opening day, we were excited and assumed they would be prepared since they had posted it all over social media.  When we walked up, we saw that there were some people there (I'd say about half the tables were seated) so we thought Yay! Good for them!  but as we walked up I noticed none of the tables had their food... strange since it was 12:00 and they had opened at 11:00 but I thought that maybe everyone came at once on their lunch break or something.\n\nThe girl who took our order did not know the menu.  We ordered things by their New-Orelans-Street-Names name that was one the menu and she would look confused for a second and say \"ohh the number 3?\".  This is super nit-picky but if you are going to put in the work to come up with names for your dishes on a theme and everything, make sure your employees know them.  You sound like a cheap Mexican or Chinese place. \n\nWe sat down outside on the great patio and waited... and waited... and WAITED. for 45 minutes.  The girl who took our order then came out flustered holding tickets trying to match up orders to tables. I saw people that had been waiting for an hour leave without food. \n\nWhen she got to our table she mentioned that one of the dishes that my coworker ordered (nachos) was not possible \"since they never got pulled pork in and the chef didn't tell\" her.  There is pulled pork at least twice on the menu, if I'm not mistaken, so there's no way she was the first to order it.  She said she'd have the chicken on it instead.  The cashier\/runner came back out again a few minutes later and said that, actually, they didn't have nachos at all.  (You mean chips?  Someone didn't buy the chips?) She was clearly frustrated, which I totally understand, but throwing the back of house under the bus doesn't get you any extra points from me. Clearly there was a major communication issue that day and they should have gone with a limited menu for the opening!\n\nShe brought out three cobblers for us when we only ordered one, which was nice, but we hadn't had any lunch yet and they are SWEET. (seriously yummy though... praline pecans in there!)\n\nOnce we did get our food, we were missing lettuce and tomatoes on one sandwich, avocados on another, and the coworker with the nacho fiasco was brought the wrong replacement sandwich.\n\nHOWEVER, the food was dang good. The shrimp were warm, delicious, and not at all overcooked.  Good bread, good tomatoes, just overall a good sandwich.  We also had the sandwich with the meatballs which was good and spicy and the sausage poboy which got good reviews. We work across the street and were lucky to have a flexible schedule on Friday but not everyone in our building does so they have to pick up the pace, especially for the fact that it feels about $2 too much for lunch (although I'm GLAD to pay it for the same food and much better\/faster service).\n\nOne note, a guy came in toward the end and was running the register as well as running food and he seemed to be whipping everyone into shape.  I wanted to high-five him as I was leaving.  \n\nI'm confident that it was just some opening-day hiccups so I will be giving them another chance (or two!) this week, but without the delicious food this would have been my worst restaurant experience in the last few years for sure. I HATE to give a low rating as the first but I'm pretty sure I'll be updating it soon!","date":"2016-03-21 15:45:07","vector":[0.0871411765,0.0,0.0,0.1199636364,0.0]}

But no more. What happened during this last trip was so egregious that nothing could convince me to stay there again or to recommend it.\n\nOn June 22 of this year I made reservations for a two night stay August 6 -8th and paid for the room in full. The stay was for myself, my wife and my daughter.  We arrived at 9:30 pm on August 6th, gave the young lady at the desk my name. She found it on the computer (I could see the screen) and then she grimaced. I joked that she didn't have a room for us: we had just seen that episode of Seinfeld where he makes a car rental reservation and shows up and they don't have a car. \"But I reserved one\" Jerry Seinfeld says, \"that's what a reservation is.\"  \"I know what a reservation is,\" the lady at the counter tells him.  \"I don't think you do,\" he responds.\n\nWell that is EXACTLY what happened to us that night at the Warwick. \"I'm sorry,\" the desk agent said, looking pained. Needless to say, I was flabbergasted. The manager shows up and explains that \"the cast of [some show] is in town, so the rooms are all booked up. \"But I booked a room, and paid for it,\" I tell her.  \"I'm sorry, we have nothing.\" WHAT?!\n\nSo they were just going to turn out a family - including a young girl - who had all just traveled 3000 miles and were expected to be warmly greeted and shown to our room.\n\nThey did offer to \"walk us\" to another fine establishment around the corner, but that would be only for one night and then it would be on us to pay in the neighborhood of $400 to stay another night at this place (about what I ALREADY PAID for two nights at the Warwick).\n\nOur minds were blown, we were totally devastated. This of course goes against the whole way the system works. If a PAID RESERVATION doesn't get you a room, what does?\n\nWhat I would really like to know is: Who made the decision to give up our room? Obviously someone had to have consciously decided to do it. Not only that, couldn't they have given us warning? If you are going to un-honor the reservation because you want the (presumably better paying) business of [some show], at least have the courtesy to give us advance warning. What, were they just hoping we wouldn't show up? (Did I mention the room was PAID FOR?)\n\nThe whole thing was beyond the pale. How a hotel could treat their guests that way is beyond me. The people running that place need a course in hotel management as well as common decency.\n\nSo what finally happened was, the tour manager of [some show] happened to be at the next check-in desk and overheard this whole thing, and he gave up one of his rooms for us. The Warwick ended up giving us a refund of 50% of the first night, and asked that we don't put this on Yelp.","date":"2016-09-18 17:35:10","vector":[0.0,0.0910666667,0.34,0.04675,0.0]}

I've eaten here twice now and have been really happy with what I ordered.  Both times I've opted for the Arepas.  The first time I had black bean and pepper jack cheese and the 2nd time I had a shredded beef and pepperjack cheese.  They were very tasty and 1 was plenty filling.  They don't mess around with beans...there were a TON of them on my plate (which is fine with me), but they were seasoned very nicely and had a nice kick to them.  The shredded beef was also seasoned very well.  I also sampled (from other people's plates) some sweet potatoes, plantains with cheese, and an apple cinnamon (?) empanada....all were good, although I'm not a huge sweet potato or plantain person so maybe my opinion isn't the most reliable on those.  They also ask you if you want your sweet\/dessert empanadas rolled in brown sugar...mmmmmm.....\n\nAs another yelper mentioned, the front door was also locked (post 11:00am) both times we showed up for lunch.  Last time, we almost turned around and went to a different restaurant bc we were on a time crunch...but the server came out just as we were stepping away.  I haven't been when it's been really busy yet or for dinner, so I can't really comment on a busy service.  The first time we went, there was a guy (possible owner?) that came out and talked about some of the recipes and the yummy sauces that went with the sweet empanadas.  He was very friendly and made us feel welcome.  \n\nSo maybe there are a few kinks to work out with service and actually getting their doors open on time, but there's no denying that the food is GOOD (and cheap!...I spent less than $6 both times) and is a nice addition to the downtown\/ftn square scene. I hope the restaurant lasts because these are the great quaint mom and pop places that indy could really use!!

The portion may have been slightly less than filling but thanks to my stellar waitress, Meaghan everything on the menu was described clearly and accurately - and enthusiastically!

We also ordered an appetizer of cheeses and the chicken poullard which was filling, seasoned perfectly and cooked to the letter. \n\nMy other observation is that James appears to be simultaneously upscale and unpretentious, which I really appreciate. Some people were dressed up, some were slightly casual, but I never got the sense that there were any sideways glances. I like when a well-curated restaurant can pull that off - because I'm usually the ding dong that drops my fork when all's quiet. \n\nNow the bad news, and this is truly not specific to the restaurant so much as it's location:  I would love for this restaurant to be ANYWHERE near a parking lot but there's no changing that.

I should never walk into a restaurant with high expectations- of course I'll be disappointed. The decor and service was perfect. Its warm and tastefully decorated and everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. The food however was not nearly as tasty as I hoped. We started out with the fresh oysters, scallop appetizer, and sunchoke soup. The fresh oysters were served chilled, with no accompanying mignotte, lemon, or garnish. I love raw oysters, but thought these would have benefitted from a little exta something- anything??? The scallop was a bit undercooked for my taste, although the flavor was there, but the accompanying belgian endive compote was bitter and had a very strange smell to it.  Kind of caused me to cringe. The sunchoke soup was delicious. We also ordered the tagliatelle, which everyone has raved about. It was good but the flavors weren't complex enough to garner all of that attention. For dinner we had the poularde (basically chicken). I'm pretty sure it was cooked sous vide style to be that moist. It was good, but not fabulous. And oh how I dearly missed the byob scene. Our alcohol was over $50 alone for some pretty yummy cocktails. We skipped dessert (although I was still a bit hungry) and the bill came out to $150 with tax and tip which is comparable to alot of byobs (not including our pricey liquor bill-what a bunch of lushes!!). Nice place to grab a cocktail but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner....","date":"2009-03-13 19:19:31","vector":[0.1476277778,0.28595,-0.0833333333,0.11492,0.0]}

Wife and I hired the babysitter and went for our birthdays, and were really happy we decided on this as our destination.\n\nIt's worth a stop at the bar before you head to your table. Fun banter with the tender, and it was a gas watching him mix their signature cocktails. There was a great selection of draught beers, but I opted for the house manhattan, made with an infused bourbon and spiced raisins instead of a cherry. Wife had a cocktail made with lemon juice, rum puree and sailor jerry rum. Yessss.\n\nThe understated and warm dining area was great. I chose their 'best of' tasting menu with wine pairings. my wife went with the regular menu. The menu goes from small serving size to larger, and is listed as such. \n\nStandouts were the langostino tempura with apricot reduction, the ribbon pasta with braised duck in chocolate and orange (trust me), and the bay scallops. Oh, the bay scallops. The wine pairings were wonderful, subtle and perfect. They were out of the standard dessert pairing and substituted a fantastic Grenache. \n\nOnly low point is that the parking ($8, reasonable priced) is at the back of a dark, seedy looking lot across the street. Probably just perceived danger, but not a nice way to end an otherwise fantastic meal.","date":"2008-01-11 07:58:11","vector":[0.1612055556,0.0,0.0,-0.00697,0.0]}

I will obviously go again. Not sure if it's because of the price, the food or Will. But I will be back!","date":"2017-07-16 14:55:37","vector":[0.00922,0.148,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The karaoke was actually pretty good... at least until our group got up there (they have a very extensive Britney Spears selection) and tried to rock the mike.\n\nWhen we first walked in, it was apparent that Charlie's usually has a more laid back atmosphere, and I was concerned that getting kicked out was imminent.  However employees and patrons alike were very understanding of our \"Girls-Gone-Semi-Wild\" antics.  Understanding isn't even the right word... they were... indulgent.  \n\nI didn't get to see a menu or a bill, so I'm afraid I can't comment on that aspect of Charlie's.

Well, mostly. I guess a strawberry isn't actually a berry.\n\nIf all their food is this good, The Oink Cafe goes onto a short list of really good East side breakfast joints.

No spice involved, chicken was fried very hard (or rather, batter was very thick\/crunchy with no flavor). It was lopped atop a small Asian slaw (shredded carrot & cuke or yicama tossed in vinegar) on a large hoagie bun. There is no way I could have picked this up to eat it, nor was it appetizing. And I am all about chomping on a big fat delicious po-boy, but this was sooo dry and huge. My friend got the special, an oyster caesar salad. The oysters themselves were superb. The dressing was flavorless. For apps we had crab\/corn bisque and summer rolls. The corn was definitely canned corn. This wouldn't be a big deal except that $46 for 2 people for lunch (no alcohol) - you would expect fresh corn or frozen so it's plumper and not dark\/deflated. The shrimp spring roll was okay.\nThe young chick who was our server did not smile at all and my friend thought she hated us or her job - not sure.","date":"2011-01-11 18:49:41","vector":[0.0430619048,-0.13775,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

He brings up the $75 charge several more times (apparently $75 is more important than the $2000 a year I pay).\n\nThen, he attempts a factory reset of my phone, and halfway through \"oh I hope you have enough battery to get through this or your phone will break and need to be replaced\"  Really??? How about telling me that ahead of time?  \n\nI mentioned I was with Sprint for 16 years  and no \"thanks for your loyalty to our company\" bu rather \"I've been with sprint for 16 years too\"  Like that is relevant to anything.   \n\nAND, just 2 days ago I was in the store and bought a Galaxy S6 for the other person on my account.  Then they're gonna treat me like this 2 days later when I need their help?\n\nI ended up leaving the store with my phone in worse condition then when I came in.  He didn't say \"sorry we couldn't help you\" or suggest any alternatives. Just blew me off and went to next customer.   Do NOT deal with this guy unless you want to have the customer service equivalent of an argument in the YouTube comments section.\n\n** UPDATE ** Went to another Sprint store and had total opposite experience.  They got my original phone to work thus allowing me to trade it in for $100.  End state: Paid $60 for a brand new G4 vs paying $75 for a refurbished G3 at original store.  See, a little courtesy and creative thinking goes a long way.","date":"2015-07-02 13:33:11","vector":[0.0,0.4019,0.0,-0.0200857143,0.0]}

We were expecting the restaurant that used to be in that location. Being hungry we decided to go in. Non discript inside pretty bland for colours and atmosphere but was clean.  You are given a menu to check off boxes. Pretty good selection, but I am not an expert on Dim Sum. We decided on the shrimp and matsutake dumplings, black truffle, pork and shrimp dumplings, deep fried squid with salt and pepper, string beans stir-fried with XO sauce and and Yangzhou stlye fried rice. People  have complained about the price and I have to agree. 18 bucks for a fried rice with nothing particularly special  with it same with XO green beans for 12. I have had better fried rice and XO beans at Double Greeting Wonton House that is probably 6 bucks cheaper. However, the dumplings were really good and I felt well worth the price. Particularly the black truffle dumplings. That was the highlight. It was delicous. We also love the deep fried squid and that the shrimp dumplings. So I guess you should just know what to order. They also charge for tea, which is usually a free given in most places. The quality of the dumplings  and the shrimp would make me come back here.  i would skip the noodles and the rice. Most things are from the 17 -20 dollar range and I wouldn't bother with that.","date":"2021-06-23 05:37:19","vector":[0.066848,-0.4019,0.0,0.27495,0.0]}

I think it's a great value but it would have been nice to be able to just order one as I was a new customer and wasn't sure how in love with their cookies I was going to be. They had some singles under a covered glass dessert tray but when I was in around 1:30 all they appeared to have left under there was oatmeal and some kind of chocolate covered shortbread cookie.\n\nThe ginger cookies were quite perfect I must say! They were nice and moist but didn't taste heavy and fattening like some dessert shop treats can turn out like. The flavor was sweet with a bit of a spicy kick which was nice as the wind outside had picked up and I had caught a bit of a chill. I got a chai latte to go with my cookies which complimented the ginger really well.

Mix matched chairs at wooden tables, tractor seats at the bar. It feels like we're eating at a roadside bbq joint. \nNext we ordered drinks. I picked a local brewery on tap, my friend picked from a huge selection of whisky. \nWhile he was getting settled, I admired the BBQ selections. In addition to chalk board descriptions, the the freshly smoked meats are in a case for all to admire. The meat is sold by the pound which allows me to make my own mixed plate! I chose brisket, ribs, pulled pork and mac n cheese. They were all smoky, which is my first test. I don't use sauce unless it's really necessary. Second, they all had a great bark. The brisket had the best crunch. Lastly, the Mac n cheese was smoky with jalapeno heat. Loved it. \nAll in all, this Virginia based, Missouri taught BBQ jerk enjoyed the whole experience. \nNext time I'm in Philly, I'm skipping the cheesesteak, and spending my hard earned money on quality BBQ.","date":"2016-03-07 00:37:47","vector":[0.1117055556,0.0,0.0,0.07025,0.0]}

I am so glad she did.  Jasmine is one of two friends who own this tiny Mexican food shop.  This female duo is making tacos, sopes and quesadillas to rival the best in Tampa.\n\nThe space is warm, modern and small with two tables plus some counterspace.   The menu is written chalkboard style on a wall...offering a variety of tacos, sopas, quesadillas, enchiladas in Mexican or American style with a range of fillings from carne asada to carnitas to chicken to picadillo.  And then there is the quacamole.   It is something unto itself.\n\nWhen you place your order, the owners head into the kitchen and make it for you on the spot.  It takes about 15-20 minutes and it is worth every one of those minutes.\n \nOn my first visit, we sampled everything.  My girls had the picadillo tacos ($2) and horchatas ($3.50).  The picadillo is wonderfully flavorful and not at all greasy.  They were easily the best ground beef tacos I had ever sampled.   The horchata was sweet, smooth and punched with cinnamon.  My girls made short order of everything and wished they had more.\n\nI ordered a picadillo sopes ($4), a carnitas enchilada ($3), a campechano enchilada ($3.50) and a veggie quesadilla ($6.50).  The sopes knocked me out.  Refried beans, picadillo, cheese and fresh avocado layered on top of a chewy corn base, every bite was rich with flavor.  The carnitas enchilada was excellent.. the pork soft and perfectly cooked.. the tortilla bathed in a delicious sauce.  The campechano enchilada was good with carne asada and chorizo.  The veggie quesadilla was filled with corn, mushrooms, poblano pepper and cheese.   It came with lettuce and pico, sour cream.. a meal unto itself.   I am so glad it was not filled with onions and green peppers.   I couldn't finish all this food so I made a couple of lunches out of the leftovers. \n\nEverything was great.. and I mean great... and yet, there is the quacamole.  It is the best quac I had ever had.  My spouse makes an excellent quac.  I have had quac made tableside, made roadside, made by tiny Mexican grannys and elite chefs.  This is the best of all of them.   It was made fresh, scooped from just ripe avocados, seasoned PERFECTLY, specked with cilantro.. and it cost all of six bucks.   Add in the homemade salsa and I could have made a meal off of the chips, quac and salsa. \n\nFast forward three nights and the spouse is craving Mexican.  This time I called in a takeout order, asked Jasmine to make the quac \"spicy\" and ordered the carne asada tacos (2.50) Mexican style with cilantro and onion.  Fifteen minutes later, I was picking up our food, complete with a side of chopped up jalapenos \"in case the quac is not spicy enough\".  The carne asada tacos rocked.  Seriously good.  The spouse ate all three tacos and didn't even share the quac.  \n\nThis place is a true find.. tucked into a tiny storefront in a Kennedy strip mall with a sign that says \"Mexican Cravings\".   It is open for lunch and dinner and closes around 8p.. long days for a pair of talented women who deserve lines out the door!   Get the guacamole.  You'll thank me.","date":"2020-03-14 00:38:49","vector":[0.11501875,0.0,0.0,0.0150866667,0.0]}

So, one nice when we didn't feel like cooking, we decided to check them out.\n\nThey have a variety of different side dish options (all of which sounded delicious) and we decided on the BBQ meal (the meal because of the great axxess deal).  We decided to pick up the food because we were curious about the location at Earl Warren.  It's located at the C entry gate, back by the barns, and looks like a converted snack stand (it's basically an industrial kitchen with a window for orders).\n\nFirst, the food:  We found the medium BBQ a good size for my husband and myself.  We finished all of the chicken and pita but had a small amount of left overs (enough for a snack the next day) of the potatoes and corn.  The chicken was great, not too dry, and delicious.  The corn was my favorite (and they were able to make it special for us without the onions).  It was probably so good because of the amount of butter used (way more than I would cook with or eat normally, but it was really really good).  The potato salad was also good, spicier than I would have thought, but I prefer it that way.  I'd go back based on the food.\n\nSecond, the service: When we called the order in, the guy taking the order was courteous but not overly helpful.  When we went to pick up the food, there was a bit of a wait (even though we arrived 20 min after we ordered as they suggested).  It seemed that the slow up was the guy taking the orders, and since I had a bit of time to observe while I was waiting, it seemed that the cook was a bit exasperated by the manner of the order\/window guy (because he responded slowly, mixed things up, and had to be told a few times which order was which).  I think if they stream lined this process, it might be better.\n\nI didn't order delivery, so I'm not sure how they are on that front.  I might try next time.\n\nWe have a bunch of family visiting in November and I think this will be a great option to please the palates of both the adults and kids!","date":"2015-08-30 17:34:34","vector":[0.05710625,0.0,0.0,0.0429857143,0.0]}

I didn't think there would be anywhere open to order from, but my hunger demanded that I check Grubhub anyway. sure enough, Virginio's pops up. I look through their lengthy menu and finally decide that I want a Stromboli. so I order the spinach and cheese Stromboli-- but I see that they have the option to add ingredients like fresh basil, fresh garlic, tomatoes, and ricotta.... so I do. I also write a little note asking if they would give me two extra sides of marinara, knowing full well that late night spots don't give a sh*t,  but I figured i'd try anyway.\n\nso my food arrives well before the anticipated delivery time, I open the box and sure enough there are three little sides of marinara in there waiting for me. a good sign, I think- they actually read what I wrote! so I try the Stromboli and it's awesome. like, it's really freakin good. I was so happy.\n\na few nights later, home from work again and starving, I order myself a small cheese pizza. their online menu says \"cheese on the bottom and sauce on the top\". I hate that. so again, I type special requests... I typed \"please make with sauce on the bottom and cheese on top like a normal pizza.\" also, I wanted pineapple on my pizza (that's my favorite) but it didn't show up in their drop-down menu options, so I also typed \"please add pineapple to the pizza and charge me accordingly-- I didn't see an option for it.\" I needed a couple more bucks to make the delivery minimum, so I added jalapeno poppers to the order. again, my food shows up before the estimated delivery time, and it's perfect. the pizza is just how I ordered it and the poppers are the cream cheese kind (score!). \n\nso tonight, I was really craving enchiladas. they have a bunch of Mexican items on the menu, but no enchiladas. so I called, and the young lady who answered the phone told me that she'd ask the kitchen if they could make them. i'm vegetarian, so I asked if I could have enchiladas verdes con queso. (cheese enchiladas with green salsa). they said ok, 45 minutes. my food showed up before the estimated time (again!) and seriously these enchiladas were exactly what I wanted. they were f*cking AWESOME. \n\nthe delivery driver is always super nice and friendly and says \"thanks for calling!\" as he's getting back into his car. \n\nseriously, if you're hungry late night (or anytime really) you should try Virginio's. a late night spot that actually cares what you order and tries to please the customer? i'm hooked!","date":"2014-03-05 09:02:23","vector":[0.118209375,0.0,0.0,0.27295,0.0]}

For starters, Indy hasn't had much to offer in terms of breakfast tacos or burritos over the year so I was giddy to hear of Brookside Burrito coming on the scene from a friend. Who doesn't love a grab and go, affordable weekday breakfast option?\n\nBefore I dig into the food, I want to talk about the mission behind Brookside Burrito (one of the coolest parts about it, in my opinion). Brookside Burrito provide jobs and critical on-the-job training to those most at risk. In their words, \"Every item on our menu tells the story of our streets, hand crafted by the folks who call these streets home. With every satisfied customer, we are reweaving the fabric of our community and helping at-risk individuals rewrite their own personal narrative.

The online ordering process is seamless too. The night before our porch breakfast, I placed the order (all burritos are $3), and scheduled my pickup for 7:30AM. I pulled up to the church where the kitchen is located, called the number and within a few minutes my bag of hot burrito goodness was back on the road. I have to say, this is a great offering for catered work breakfasts, etc. \n\nWe ordered a variety of burritos - vegetarian, the One and Onley (named after the street and filled with egg, potato, meat, cheese), and a few others.

We are not huge fans of most southern charcuterie, but I can say that the bison lengua rillette was quite tasty and a HUGE portion. The cheeses that we tried (one a jerk spiced cheddar, the other a porter soaked cheddar) were good. The jerk spiced cheddar was excellent. \n\nThen my husband had the pork belly. He thought it was phenomenal. I thought it was a little overcooked, but the seasoning was very tasty. The portion was humongous. I had the panzanella salad. It was also huge. It was very refreshing with tons of avocado and crisp tomatoes. Let the bread sit in the dressing for a while to avoid chipping a tooth.\n\nFor our mains, my husband had the red snapper, and I had the duck. The snapper was excellent. Very light, not fishy at all. My husband cleared his plate. I found the duck to be less successful. The breast was not seared well, and the fat was really greasy\/soggy. The duck confit was not very tender. I ate less than half of it, although admittedly, I was pretty full from the charcuterie and salad.\n\nWe definitely did not have room for dessert. \n\nMy husband had the First Flight cocktail, which was only okay. I think we weren't very impressed by the \"Peruvian gin.\" We were also unimpressed with the wine list, so we opened our own bottle (corkage $20).

The industrial art deco furnishings catch one's eye as soon as you enter the restaurant. Now, I never order craft cocktails, as they are mostly overpriced & underwhelming. But, my date told me to give one a try, & I ordered the Opposable Thumbs. Blew me away so much, I ordered another. The best coffee infused cocktail I have ever had in my life. As appetizers the pimento crab corn fritters & the cider braised mussels were a cornucopia of flavor profiles I have never experienced. As entrees, the seared sea diver scallops were so tender & sweet it was like eating a dessert. And the pork shank pot pie was tasty & scrumptious. The \"only\" reason I don't give this fabulous restaurant 5 stars, is that in addition to being one of Tampa's best dining experiences, it is one of Tampa's loudest restaurants, & I have been to most all Tampa elite restaurants. My voice was literally horse from having to speak so loudly for my date to hear me, & she was 3 feet from me. The restaurant is all brick & metal, so the sound has nowhere to be absorbed. The restaurant manager told us they are working with an engineer on alleviating the sound issues. This won't keep me from coming back to this culinary delight of a restaurant. But in about 5 months when the weather cools in hot Tampa, I will definitely request outside seating in their cool area for outside dining.","date":"2019-05-23 00:38:15","vector":[0.1904692308,0.0,0.0,0.18352,0.0]}

I discovered Catering By Robert while attending a Bridal Show at the Davis Island Garden Club. They were showcasing a French Quarter Menu that night which couldn't be any better for me since I was set and determined to have a New Orleans stayed wedding. I was immediately attracted to the vendor and upon tasting the Jambalaya in the huge paella pan I was pretty much sold. My Husband and I met up with Susan shortly after and went over all of the offerings. CBR provided in house decorations, linen, china, glassware and even bar services. Not to mention the client tastings that was held every other month. I think we will definitely miss those the most. What we loved MOST about CBR was working with Susan was a breeze and the communication was always on point. We definitely also loved the fact that we didn't have to add as many vendors with the decor items, linens, napkins, china and bar services. Typically these can be separate and costly. CBR does have a few menu options however they always stood up for the challenge of anything we wanted. Food was really important to us for our wedding as most of our friends and family knows us for cooking but we certainly couldn't cater our own wedding. Our wedding was held on 2\/18 and we still have guests calling or telling us that the food was superb and definitely not wedding food. One of Must haves was finishing the night with beignets to complete the New orleans style wedding and Susan and her staff delivered. The Jambalaya with crayfish was a hit, the whipped mashed potatoes was a hit, the crab cakes and pickles was amazzzinng and the beignets was the icing on the cake! We could not have asked for anything more in a wedding caterer. We really enjoyed working with Susan and the staff and I recommend them to all of my friends constantly.

Since Catering By Robert only has their \"Tasting Events\" every other month, my son, daughter and wife were very anxious to check out their offerings. They expected the food, set-ups and interest in the attendees to be at their best and prepared, primed and ready to show off their stuff. What a solid disappointment in every aspect.\n\nUpon arrival, the hosts didn't introduce themselves to the three groups present. They didn't even ask who was the bride or groom (\"You can sit here, if you want\"). My family didn't witness the expected care and interest, as proven by the wrinkled tablecloths & napkin setups or the already-burned candles on the tables. This felt like either no one was assigned the task to take care of the details, or they have been doing this for so long, they lost their caring attitude.\n\nNow let's head on to the food (it would have heen best to head on to the parking lot to leave instead.). The buffet line brought back memories of middle school cafeteria lunch. The only thing missing from the salad bin was the plastic Winn-Dixie bag it probably was dumped from. Bins of bland standard sweet potatoes, red no-taste kidney beans (!), and scary white boiled tasteless chicken were next in line. A bin of Hawaiian breadrolls was the delectable bread choice. The topper was a dish that contained chunks of various seafood product swimming in white water: no taste, depth or interest for miles on this one. The only minor salvage was a young guy slicing too-thick chunks off a roast beef.\n\nThe hosts did their best answering questions, but, evidently the chef was too busy to show up for two hours every other month to proudly brag about the offerings.\n\nThe end of the event was as watery as the seafood soup: not a positive impression at all.

I have been to one other Rita's (Hunting Park Ave) and while the offerings were consistent, the ambiance was immensely better. It looks like an old tyme ice cream shoppe almost, but of course with a Philly flair.\n\nTo start, Rita's menu is basically different ratios and mixtures of their famed Italian ice and a custard that is now a soft serve ice cream due to an egg shortage. I cannot comment on the custard versus soft serve since I am a new convert, but those who were lucky enough to have tried both agree they taste similar. \n\nI am a huge fan of the Gelati (custard, ice, custard) and recommend the blood orange and mango ice and the vanilla and coffee custard. The ice is so light yet refreshing yet satisfies my sweet tooth and is the perfect complement to the custard that to me tastes like cool whip, but others disagree. \n\nI didn't enjoy the honeydew ice nor the Blendini (blend of ice, custard and a topping) since the topping seems to overwhelm the ice. \n\nOverall, this Rita's delivers the Italian ice I look forward to and even has outdoor seating for those summer nights that call for an icy treat.","date":"2015-09-03 01:56:21","vector":[0.1488142857,0.0,0.0,0.08808,0.0]}

He ordered 1\/2 chocolate and 1\/2 mango, but he was given 1\/2 chocolate and 1\/2 orange. Then, to make matters worse, the \"orange\" or whatever it was had dots of a mysterious 'red' (cherry, maybe) flavor swirled in. Definitely not what we ordered. Get it together Ritas - I will not return to this location.","date":"2012-09-09 23:17:14","vector":[0.15361,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

My friend requested a straw but it wasn't brought out until 10 minutes later. Our  waitress was a little slow with service. She was very nice but could have checked on us more often and asked for our order sooner. Other than that the staff was very polite. \n\nI was very pleased with the food. We started off with calamari which is usually a hit or miss but in this case it was a hit! It was nicely coated with batter, crunchy, and not rubbery at all. \n\nThe Crafthouse club flatbread was 1\/2 off and only $7 on the happy hour menu! Such a great deal and delicious. It was a thicker crust which held up well. Nicely packed with chicken, bacon, and avocado. \n\nMy margarita was perfect! It didn't taste artificial and wasn't acidic at all. It was very refreshing. \n\nThe limoncello cake was a nice treat for my BFF's birthday. This cake was moist, lightly sweet, and melted in your mouth. The best lemon cake I've ever had! It was to die for. A must try! \n\nOverall the waiters can improve on their service time but other than that I really enjoyed dining here at night with the beautiful lights and music playing outside.

The eggs were delicious and so hearty: 3 perfectly cooked soft boiled eggs (firm whites with soft centers) in a delicious tomato sauce with toasted flatbread. I'm totally ordering it again!

While awaiting myself and husband's food, one of the waitresses bring my soup over. While eating I just so happen to turn around being observant, I watched the waitress after walking around touching on everything grab a tortilla for the soup she was about to serve, crumble it up and put it in the soup with her bare hands and serve it to a customer. I pulled the waitress to the side because I did not want to get her in any trouble but did want to address what I had just witnessed. I did advise the waitress that when dealing with and handling people food, she should wear gloves especially when walking around and touching on everything. She immediately apologized and said she understood and would do so and we left it at that. She went to the restroom and was gone for a little while, then came out of the restroom with another young lady which whom she was speaking and that young lady threw her hands up in the air as if to say \"who cares\". Ten minutes later a tall gentleman in a suit came over, No Introduction, No Hi or Hello, No I'm the Manager, No is Everyone Okay, No What Happened.. He just walked over, turned back and asked the young lady was this the table and turned back to us and said \"As Far as I Know, There are No Gloves Required When Handling or Touching The Plates\". Me and my husband looked at one another in confusion and said what are you talking about, that's not what happened and I explained to him and he said ok, I'll talk to her. No apology, Not a \"It Won't Happen Again...Nothing. I immediately became upset because that's not how you approach a customer or client, especially being a Manager of the establishment and when the waitress came over and asked about our food that we hadn't even touched, I Expressed everything to her. She walked off and I guess spoke with the Manager..who then walked back out passed us, then eventually came back with a business card and apologized because he didn't feel there was an introduction needed because we had already spoken earlier in regards to \"No Gloves Being Needed When Serving Food\". Me and my husband we're confused again, because we NEVER spoke..this is our first time here. He apologized and said he thought we had already spoken and left us with a card. We called corporate and spoke to someone and the GM Leo gave us a call back and sincerely apologized and offered for us to come back with dessert or an appetizer on him. I appreciate it but this was it for me, that first impression was ever lasting and I won't be returning.","date":"2019-03-06 20:55:38","vector":[0.0,-0.0422857143,0.0,0.0282875,0.0]}

I told him there was no way we could sit there when the music was already so loud. At this point I was literally yelling in his ear to make this conversation. He said sorry we have a lot of big parties today. \nThere were about two empty tables on the other side and yet he didn't offer or explain. No apologies, nothing.

So I came back a couple weeks ago, purchased three bottles of it, got home, tried each, and they were clearly turned from heat damage. A noticeable raisiny chemical taste that was not present in the bottle the first time I had bought it and which made it undrinkable. I went back with the bottles, each almost totally full, and told them the problem. They didn't believe there was a problem with it because they were twist off bottles and therefore they couldn't be so they corked\". They each tried a sip, acknowledged that it tasted raisiny, but said they wouldn't let me replace it with bottles that were drinakable. Seems weird because it would have been a very weird and pointless scam on my part (nor did they accuse me of scamming, the employees were very polite and didn't dismiss me out of hand, I got the impression it's just bad policy), and this isn't a struggling small business. It's owned by DiBrunos. Anyway if you shop here you better hope the case wasn't left in a hot truck or something! \n\nedit\/\/FOLLOW-UP: I ordered four bottles of bebame online and they're all really good so I was definitely right about the ones i got here being turned.

Half of the store inventory is dibruno products of cheese, meats, spreads, crackers, etc, which are items that can be purchased down the street at the original Dibruno's storefront, let alone every supermarket in the region. While having some snacks there is a great idea for folks that want to buy a bottle to sit and drink while munching, it feels that the selection of the alcohol needs to be enhanced in order to present differentiation and a \"draw\" to this store vs others in the area.

She asked if we wanted ranch or ketchup and we said both. After a half an hour we finally got our food. My sandwich, while large, was covered in HUGE chunks of uncooked onions which was unappealing and had 3 different kinds of cheese globs that were warm while the meat inside was cold. The other sandwich was covered in marinara sauce and the bread burned to a crisp. Come to find out we were given the sausage and pepper sandwich. Every time we tried to get the waitress to let her know she would walk away (the place only had a few eating customers) after about 10 minutes we started to eat the sandwiches but my husband could even get a few bites of the over cooked sausage sandwich. The server inally came after waiving my arms all over to catch her attention but it took another 15 mins (25 minutes total).

She offered to have it remade but by this time we were just done so she had who I think was the manager come by. She came to the table never letting us know who she was, so we told her the problem and got the rude response \"so what do you want to do..have it remade or taken off?\" We said didn't want it remade so she took it off the bill and brought us the bill with not one person apologizing for any of it. Then come to find out when asked if we wanted that ranch, we weren't told it was .88 cents for it. Not sure how this place is voted best of anything as the service and the food were poor as was the cleanliness of it as our table ws filthy when we sat down (all were filthy so it was a choice of which was cleanest) and thankfully my tomato allergy doesn't cause anaphylaxis since I'm having a reaction to the tomato that must have been just taken off my sandwich or cross contaminated somehow.

I am a sucker for great apple pies - in my books, they are those that are not overly sweet until you cannot taste the apples, but actually smell like apples with a crispy butter crust, and made with natural ingredients. Simple expectation for an apple pie, but so hard to find. \n\nSo I bought two Dutch Apple Pies without tasting and prayed that they would be good because they were USD18 each. I would have paid alot more if I knew how wonderful they are!!!  They turned out heavenly scrumptious. If only I was offered a taste, I would have bought at least a dozen! I live in LA and was in Pollock Pines for a few days get-away. Reno was a side trip.\n\nNot being a baker myself, heating up an apple pie is a hit and miss. I wiish the pies came with heating instructions so that they can be enjoyed in the best possible way. At the cabin, I heated the oven to a 350 degrees, and had the pie in there for nine minutes. The pie was glorious. \n\nThe other pie, I brought to San Jose, as a gift for family, and was heated differently,  it was good but did not turn as great as the first one. My conclusion is that a great pie heated incorrectly could impact the entire outcome.  \n\nSo two things - more tastings will definitely sell more pies, and instructions on reheating, these delicious, beautifully made pies will ensure the integrity of their  magnificence.","date":"2013-07-03 14:46:21","vector":[0.1977875,0.0,0.08895,0.2394666667,0.4404]}

There is a big outdoor area that looks like it could be a great spot; however it wasn't open as there were hardly enough patrons to bother.  The reason why this place is suffering is the drinks are over priced.  Also the bartender has to use a jigger, and in New Orleans that is a kiss of death- might as well close up shop if you are that stingy in a booze town.   Also we were sitting at the bar and the bartender had two clear unrefrigerated containers one of lemon wedges and one of limes.  The limes were brown like not brownish, BUT disgustingly brown.  This was nasty like bleecky WTF nasty like rotten fruit. Also no food served.\n \nThe Crown and Anchor English Pub is a neighborhood bar without that many neighbors hanging out.  On a Friday night you could even go there alone to have a table to yourself for your labtop.  $6 for a draft, $5 for a domestic,$3.5 for a bottle premium priced mixed drinks with like 1 ounce of booze*. People who drink and go there are people who want to go to someplace near that is near empty near all the time.\n\nAfter going here it is a disappointment because the bar could be a gold mine except for the owners\/managers must be pathologically stingy, so much so that the best thing that could be said is that it is one of the most empty bars you are likely to find in or around New Orleans. \n\nPS In retrospect I should have taken a picture of the limes.

Though the texture of the foie was honestly divine, pairing this with peanuts made the dish way too salty to thoroughly enjoy. The balance between sweet and salty was not even close which is a criticism that followed through the whole evening.\n\nScallop Noodles: The dish I was most looking forward to all night from Top Chef fame. Though the dish sounds gimmicky, the texture of the noodles and the flavor they impart really adds to the dish but like the Foie, the broth was beyond salty (almost too much to finish it) and the smoked hoison turned out to be way more sour then anything else.\n\nCobia: Overall this dish was the best of the night simply because it wasn't super super salty (though by no means a perfect dish). Overall though, the fish was a bit on the dry side and the black truffle fummete sauce was a bit too lemony and had to be left alone in order to enjoy the rest of the meal.\n\nCookie Dough: Honestly the biggest letdown of the night. I understand the whole sweet\/salty vibe that they were trying to get to and I loved the gooeyness of the dish but the chef honestly forgot to put any sugar into my cookie and all I tasted was a big bite of salt. I tried mixing it with the ice cream and the meringue hoping it would cut the salt action but to no effect. \n\nOn the plus side, the Saviougn Blanc was really delicious and a steal at under $25 due to Philly wine week. In addition, the sizes of the tasting menu were quite generous (probably 30% bigger then most restaurants) and under no circumstances did I leave the meal hungry.\n\nWhen you pay close to $100 per person on a special meal for a special occasion, having this many fundamental errors of having a way too heavy hand with the salt is really inexcusable and a big letdown.","date":"2017-03-27 02:12:00","vector":[0.1430514286,0.20095,0.01265,0.0336,0.0]}

The pizza was pretty good also.  We ordered an Italian sausage, red onion and jalapeno.  The jalapeno was fresh, not out of a can or jar, which I love.  The Italian sausage looked like sausage links had been cut up, which I love.  The crust was thin, which I love, however it wasn't cooked in a coal oven, so it was just thin crust, without any of the crispness that a coal (or   od) oven produces.  Still, it wasn't too bad. The best part of the meal was the dessert.  We had the canolli, and it was excellent!  Great tasting Ricotta, the shell was perfect.  Their bar isn't too bad either, several beers on tap.

Do they live up to this title? Meh, I've definitely been to better \"Irish\" pubs. Wait hold the phone.  If they're not the best or even in contention, why in the holy name of corned beef am I giving them 4 stars? Well, I've been to NOLA three times now since 2007 and this is now an absolutely must-stop place for me, and not simply because we share a name.\n\nThe crowds mid-day are relatively thin and you have a good chance to chat with the bartenders, who are always incredibly friendly.  One was even a fellow New Yorker and we chatted about the Buffalo Bills--she spotted me as I was showing off my New York pride with a Brooklyn Brewery t-shirt. We've also been there twice during March Madness and it's been a fun place to watch the games especially the early ones.  We trash-talked with some Kansas fans (Syracuse had beat Kansas for the title just a few  years prior), then became friends over pints. It gets packed (like every other place nearby) at night, but even then there is usually still room to stand comfortably or even grab a seat on a funky barstool.\n\nSo throw out your connotations that it should be a great Irish bar (they do lose one star for this, as I do consider it a misnomer).

We had the Crab cake Benedict which was really good.  I  have had this before at other places and yet this was one of the best Crab cake Benedict I have had.  Desert was also done similar to the raw bar you go and help yourself to all you want.  The table is set up with different types of deserts everything from chocolate croissants to cookies and tarts of different styles.  Over all we really liked Nineteen XIX and would return.  It was a great change of pace from what brunch has turned into these days of loud talking and people taking selfies, wait staff feeling that they are doing you a favor by serving you food at a too close to the next selfi taking table.

High ceilings and windows, low light, a fireplace in the winter (which is reason to go there in and of itself) and gorgeous balcony seating in the summer...if you need a romantic and lavish date spot, this is your place. \n\nThere is a fairly good selection of wines, although they're categorized in a slightly odd way (e.g. full bodied, medium bodies, etc.), that are not exorbitantly priced for a hotel bar. The calamari is also wonderful, although the cheese plate is a bit sparse for the price tag.

We opted for a bloody mary and their choclate shake stout to drink. Yum! The bloody mary was delicious, not too spicy and very affordable. A must for an early weekend seafood lunch. \nThe bar was pretty empty for it being so early which was fine, it was nice to take in the place and really just relax a bit. My only ONLY issue that I had with the bar, is by the time it got to lunch time, it was a family affair. I know this is a family owned restaurant, but it seems if you wanted some beverage-adult time to watch the game a be an east coast Pats rooting person, you would have to watch yourself. I had a family with kids sitting next to me at the bar (which I didnt know kids could sit right at the bar). SO everytime I wanted to make a comment about the crazy football game on, I had an eight-year-old sitting next to me.\nThat was my ONLY concern, I still enjoyed my time there. For a little noshing we went with the fresh oysters and \"chowda\" for apps. Being in Tucson I am always weary of fresh oysters, but these did not dissapoint. Seemed more like the smaller pacific oysters, but I loved the presentation with a spciy horseraddish cocktail sauce. My husband, who is a southie, loved the chowda.\nFor main course, he had the lobster roll and I had the crab cake sandwhich. The lobster roll was a good size, and Jackson has made it thier own with it being served hot. The sandwhich had a bit of a kick to it as it was seasoned with what tasted like a bit of fennel, but I could be wrong. Just know going in it tastes a bit more flavorful that what you are used to. Good sizes, prices during the game were fab!

We arrived around 6:45pm, and were able to find a cozy spot in the back. Our waitress had a bit of trouble finding us in time for happy hour but she still honored our time and we got our 4 appetizers and drinks at the happy hour price. Unfortunately that was the best part of the experience this visit only we didn't know it yet. \n We hadn't been able to sit in the tavern our previous visit and came to pretty much try all the apps we could. Those were the garlic mussels, a dozen of the oysters on a half shell, clam cakes, and the calamari. We had the mussels on the previous visit and they were still fantastic although the portion could be a smidge bigger. Next the oysters arrived, which looked great but weren't scraped from the shells so you had to pry them out before eating them. I wouldn't normally consider this a big deal but the dozen oysters is still $17 at happy hour. Then the calamari, which arrived semi-cold and had raw portions of the breading still clumped together in the basket. Even worse the breading had no taste and the actual squid was rubbery. Finally the clam cakes, they arrived hot but were just big balls of dough about the size of my fist with a tiny overly chewy quarter sized clam in the center. After we tried the food my wife and I just sat staring at the uneaten pieces wondering how food like this came out of a Metzger kitchen. We used to be regulars at Jax Kitchen and the Abbey and the food has always been top notch. If we go back again we know which appetizers to avoid, but it makes me hope we don't have to if Brian still reads all the Yelp reviews like he used to.","date":"2015-02-25 01:05:36","vector":[-0.0071565217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Their property is totally blighted and constantly covered with graffiti\/trash.  Carl's keeps raw chicken festering on the small side street next to their establishment.  Go ahead - check it out.  On any given day you will see cardboard boxes full of chicken\/meat\/ice-shavings\/trash just sitting out in the alley next door - in the blazing summer heat.  It's revolting.  (Seriously folks - this is NOT the place to buy your meat. It may be cheap, but it's cheap for a reason.)  \n\nTheir patrons are constantly blocking traffic and they do NOTHING to stop them.  The workers\/owners\/delivery trucks\/patrons use the RESIDENTIAL streets as their personal loading dock.  There are various of meat shops in the Italian Makers.  NONE of them block streets, allow patrons to disrupt neighbors, or use the street as a warehouse.  Graffiti takes ages to be cleaned off of their various abandoned and blighted buildings.  And the smell, dear me!  Trust me, don't walk down that side street during the summer months.  Phew!  It's as if Carl's uses the side streets as their own personal warehouse for meat.  (Who needs refrigeration?  Or cleanliness?  It's only raw meat we're dealing with.)  There is meat juice all over the sidewalk and adjoining roads because they clean equipment on the PUBLIC sidewalk and road..  \n\nThe owner also owns blighted properties all up and down the block AND the trash dump that is across the street on the SW corner.  He's also responsible for the gratified, abandoned building on directly south of the shop.  Yep, same folks.\n\nIt is vendors like this that keep the Italian Markets down.  Who would blight the very market they sell in?  It's shocking to everyone who lives in and loves the neighborhood.  I can't imagine owning business and letting my other properties literally rot and decay all around it.  If you're not going to use them, fine.  Fix them up and sell them to a entrepreneur who will actually bring foot traffic and $$ to the markets.  Instead Carl's owners just let them sit, rot and fester.  How is that good for the neighborhood or business?  It was once brought up in a zoning meeting (the general uncleanliness of his properties) and he said, \"You live in Philadelphia - what do you expect?  It's trashy.\"  (Naturally this guy does not live in the Italian Markets.)  It's trashy because of vendors like this, who don't even live in Philly.   What does it matter to him?  He makes a quick buck, and leaves the street filthy - why take the effort to clean it up?  \n\nThere are plenty of wonderful meat shops in the Italian Markets who are clean and respectful of the neighborhood and the markets as a whole.  Skip this Carl's and support vendors who support a vibrant (and clean) market!

This Chinese dessert house made its way to Edmonton after starting off in Calgary's chinatown. I have heard the prices are comparable to the original location, but it's quite expensive considering the price for 1 bowl is enough to buy ingredients for a whole pot! Of course, we wouldn't be here if everyone could make their own.\n\nThere is a ton of items listed, but not available, on their menu. My guess is they either had the food chef leave after opening or they listed it planning for future growth. That or they simply copied Calgary's version of the menu and crossed off everything they weren't offering. Either way, please stop being stingy and reprint your menus. It's been nearly half a year and your second location, so I think you can spare some change and not frustrate the hell out of your customers. It's a problem when half (LITERALLY half!) the menu is crossed off.\n\nAnyways, we are here to talk about the food. It's not worth the price they charge but, I have got to say, the desserts are delicious and made authentically from raw ingredients. The almond drinks\/desserts aren't smooth, but it proves they use real almonds versus artificial flavouring. Their tofu fa (or bean curd as they call it) was typical, but they give you the option of adding red bean or black sesame paste to it. I ordered red bean, but their black sesame paste was so amazingly delicious that I regret not being a little more adventurous. Again, their sesame paste was not smooth because it was made from grinding up real sesame seeds! If you order any of their steam egg items, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes as they make it from scratch and steam to ensure freshness. They also have rose tea, bubble tea, and taiwanese drinks available. These are drinks are borderline averagely priced to expensive. One thing to note about the drinks: If you take out, the containers are free. But if you stayed and ordered it with take out containers, they will charge you. No option of staying partly and leaving with a drink? Haha...I'm a little confused over that myself.\n\nTheir service was alright. Nothing to rave about or complain about. They did their job, but nothing exceptional.\n\nThis place would deeply hurt my wallet if I made this a regular experience, but for group hangouts, this isn't too bad. Oh, as a side note, this place can only accommodate for about 20 people at a time. With how long the food takes to get to you and limited seating, it may take a while for you to get a table\/food. Hope you have good company! For those of you like me who have wonderful Chinese mothers who can do it all, I will be ordering these desserts from home. For those who don't, this is a piece of heaven away from home with a slightly higher price tag.","date":"2011-12-10 10:28:56","vector":[0.0362818182,0.0,0.0,0.0965857143,0.0]}

There's always more to discover. I think it's because business owners are finding out that commercial real estate there is a bit cheaper than in other parts of town and thanks to sites like this one, you don't have to rely solely on neighborhood residents for business. People, routinely, travel to patronize new businesses.\n\nAnd that's how I came upon District Coffee (see? It works). Ambling a bit farther down Sidco than I usually do, I was pleased to see a nice-sized parking lot waiting for me. Walking in I was pleased (again) to note that the space is larger than it comes across in pictures and print. There are four distinct sitting areas (stools by the window, tables along the wall, a conference room of sorts, and another walled area of group seating). As soon as you walk in, you'll see the counter with the small menu behind it. If you'd like some prepackaged nibbles, they've got you covered there as well. I found both employees with whom I interacted to be very nice. The space and vibe are both extremely enjoyable. That's why I am bummed to give DC a 3.5. I liked everything but what I drank.\n\nI came here in late spring which felt more like mid-summer (thanks, climate change!). I needed something iced and refreshing. My gut was to go with a chai but I tend to like trying seasonal offerings when I go to coffee shops, so I did that. I ordered the raspberry matcha iced tea. I contemplated the blood orange coffee soda (combo could go to the left) and the honey lavender latte (may be too creamy a mouthfeel) but thought I made the right choice. The barista brought my drink to me (score!) and I was happy about the dark green color. But as soon as I tasted it... my joy lessened greatly. The drink was incredibly chalky. I know matcha *can* run on the grainy side but this was hard to drink. I tasted very little (if any) raspberry. It *was* iced (and cold) but to spend (nearly) $6 on a drink I couldn't quite stomach and needed to rely on the ice melting to make it drinkable... that's disappointing.\n\nI'm willing to wager I made a mistake. Maybe I should have gone with a tried and true before trying something new. Looking at the reviews, I'm very much the outlier so I must have done something wrong. Or, maybe that raspberry matcha iced tea is not the jam. In any event, I'd like to try something else.

Needless to say we found more than enough beauty in the hills, and spent several hours together making magical memories and taking gorgeous pictures. Every moment we spent with Kiel was fun, enjoyable, and quite frankly perfect. He is so easy to be around, made us comfortable, made us laugh, and reminded us of how exciting this whole wedding thing really is :) The time flew by, and we were left with pictures that exceeded all our expectations. Now we are even more excited about the wedding later this year and what incredible images Kiel will be capturing. \n\nInspired, enthusiastic, professional, creative, committed, fun, passionate, talented...these are only a few of the words that best describe Kiel.

Based on reviews, I figured the neighborhood left a little to be desired. But it made me just want to try it even more! My bf and I drove there and realized it was right across from Jazz Daiquiris, where a murder took place not too long ago. Anyhow, that still didn't stop me. In fact, it probably enticed me even further because I wanted to know what this little hole in the wall was! As soon as we walked in, we noticed that everyone in there was Latino. That was a good sign! The food was great and cheap to boot. The tacos, quesadillas and burritos were 5\/6 bucks.  Not the best ever, but definitely the best this California girl has had in NOLA. Have you ever noticed that many carne asada tacos here are served on flour tortillas? No bueno. I need corn tortillas and just the meat and onion\/cilantro blend. And that's what this place served! And there was this amazing soup some of the other patrons ordered that I want to try next time. The salsas were muy delicioso. No one really speaks English and there's was an awesome jukebox that plays loud Spanish music.","date":"2012-08-07 04:52:06","vector":[0.0220428571,0.0,0.0,0.2423,0.0]}

I ordered a large cappuccino and a turkey and cheese panini. It didn't take too long to receive my order.  What I received was beyond disappointing. The cappuccino was awful. It was mostly foam and what little actual liquid there was at the bottom of the cup was scalding hot and bitter. The panini was flavorless but worse, it was stuck to the paper it came in, so in order to eat it I had to peel away the pieces of paper in tiny strips. All of this cost me $18+ dollars.
