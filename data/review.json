This restaurant is an amazing experience from start to finish. Tucked back behind a Rtiz Theatre and Positano Coast, this isn't a place that would normally would stand out, but word has travelled far and wide that this is a must try restaurant in Philly at this point. \n\nWe went in two of the last three years for my wife's birthday and couldn't have left happier. They do every aspect of a restaurant experience right. The servers are all really friendly, and explain what every item is for those of us who's only experience with Israeli food is Zahav. The bartenders treat you like family and take great care of you when dining at the bar. Chris, who was waiting on us from behind the bar last night, was tremendous. He explained everything in great detail, took my wife's dietary restrictions and immediately pointed out three things we'd want to avoid on the menu, and took my love for Bluecoat Gin and instantly had a drink in mind for me, which was delicious. Plus, he was good to chat with for the very short period between courses. \n\nThe food is all so different from what I'm used to, but I am yet to try something here that I didn't love. For example, I've never eaten hummus (I know, not that scary) other than the two visits I've had to Zahav (it's a choice I've made, also won't touch tofu or turkey bacon for example), but when I'm here I'll go for it and it's just delightful. When you consider the fact that when you order the tasting with another person you are going to eat literally about 20 different items in that sitting. There should be something that completely grosses you out, but it just doesn't happen for some reason. You sit there wondering if there could be anyone there not loving their experience. It's that good. \n\nSome things I loved:\n-The hummus, both their traditional tahina and the warm Turkish. Delicious with that bread fresh out of the oven. \n-The crispy grape leaves. Never enjoyed one as much as these. Nice little kick of heat in them as well.\n-The grilled Haloumi. This cheese, if you haven't tried it, is a game changer. I honestly didn't even realize it was a cheese when I ordered it, but then instantly remembered the last place I had it, which was Kanella, as soon as I bit into it. So good.\n-The fried potato. Super crispy. Super delicious. \n-The branzino. The fish has a perfectly crispy skin on top, great flavor, and the tzatziki just adds to it. \n\nIf you like trying different foods and thinking spending a little extra for a perfect dining experience is worth it, this is somewhere you want to be.","date":"2015-12-05 15:05:04","vector":[0.2971291667,0.6369,0.0,0.10415,0.146475]}

I did a last minute trip to Philly and did not really have time to do extensive research. Shame on me.\nLuckily, my friends told me about Zahav as I was riding the Amtrak to Philly. I immediately went on OpenTable to book a seat for 1. Surely I could get a table for 1. Well.. nope. The restaurant was full. I looked at a bunch of Yelp reviews and learned that you had to book this restaurant 3 months in advance.  \nWell, I decided to walk in and try my luck. After all, Anthony Bourdain did eat here and it is one of my life goals to eat at all the restaurants that he has eaten at.\nAs soon as I checked into my hotel, I wasted no time in heading to Zahav. I got to the restaurant around 6:30pm and saw a lot of people waiting. Oh no... would I have to wait too? Well, the host led me straight to the bar where there was an open seat. I felt as if I had just won the jackpot!\nI settled in my seat and ordered a glass of wine. The bartender that took care of me was absolutely fantastic! I was sitting next to some awkward dude who was eating alone, and we happened to order the same thing. He happened to order before me so his food would come out first, then mine would come out 10 min later, and they were quite similar. I promise I wasn't copying him!\nI've never had Israeli cousins before, the only thing I knew was that I would not eat pork. That was the extent of my knowledge. The bartender suggested that I do the \"taste of zahav\", which consists of a 4 course meal, with multiple dishes in each course. He suggested that I should take it easy on the appetizers, so that I could focus on eating the main course. After all, the appetizers were  easily packable to bring home. The course cost $48, and is a great way to taste everything. You can also do wine paring for an additional $36. Let's dive into each course:\nCourse #1: salatim & hummus with laffa. Salatim means salads- you get 6 different small salads such as cabbage salad, eggplant salad, green bean salad etc. These were good. The hummus was amazing, there are 3 types to choose from. I had the daily hummus, which had some chicken in it. The bread that comes with the hummus is AMAZING. I almost died. It was so soft and pillowy and fluffy.... Yum. I had a really hard time not eating the whole bread, because I needed to save space for the rest of the courses. \nCourse #2: 2 mezze. You can pick 2 small dishes from the menu. I picked the fried cauliflower and haloumi. The dark hearts are quite a popular dish, the guy next to me had it... I am not a fan of eating hearts but if you like hearts, I hear its good here. Both dishes were good. The haloumi was amazing, it came with blueberries and pistachio, which sounds like a weird combination, but actually tasted fantastic. \nCourse #3: Al Ha'esh- grilled dish over coals. I had the grilled branzino. To be honest, I was quite full at this point but ate the whole thing. The skin was nice and crispy, the fish was soft and tender.\nCourse #4: Desert. I had grilled peach with sherbert, and za'atar shortbread.  The shortbread had a nice twice to it, it tasted different from Walkers' shortbread. \nThe waiter packed all my leftovers for me in separate containers... which I ate that night before going to bed. \nI had a wonderful experience here and can't wait to come back. Remember, if you walk in by yourself, you might score a seat at the bar with minimal wait! Or else, make your reservation exactly 3 months in advance!","date":"2018-09-14 14:25:32","vector":[0.1000384615,0.1646333333,0.24835,0.1028857143,0.0]}

My friend and I are both students, and normally are given crappy service as a result. At Zahav, the waiter could not have been more patient, explaining each menu item and its flavors. The owner came over in the middle of our meal to ask how it was going as well as at the end of the meal to make sure we had had a great meal. Our meal was the definition of relaxed comfort-I described the atmosphere to one of my friends as 'like a neighborhood place'.\n\nIn terms of highlights, the salatim definitely stands out as a can't miss; a large selection of tasty small dishes. There wasn't a bad dish among the ones we had, each unique and full of flavor. My friend basically devoured the hummus, so I have to assume it was good. The potato latke with salmon was also great; it's the kind of dish that you're sad when it's over because it was that good. The duck kebab kind of looked like a 'duck hamburger' in a small patty; I didn't taste the pistachios in it but it still tasted great.\n\nPerhaps the only not amazing part (of which the service more than makes up for) was the dessert. The pistachio cookie of my caramel semifreddo was very tough, although the flavors were good. my friend had the baklava and didn't like it as much as the regular dishes. \n\nAll in all, I would gladly pay non-RW prices; it was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to come back soon.","date":"2012-02-01 03:44:12","vector":[0.093132,0.1806,0.25,0.0,0.24695]}

There is usually only ONE waitress. We brought a huge group once, and I just felt so terrible for her, because it so happened that day was incredibly busy without our group being there.\n\nAnyway, get the pho when you come here.

We are pretty neglected over here and to have a sushi-ya in it is fantastic!\n\nThe chef is a bit deaf in his right ear, so speak up if you want his attention.  He's a chatty fellow if you catch him during a slow time.  He worked somewhere in New York before here in Tucson.  He lives in Rita Ranch and walks to work as he does not have a driver's license!\n\nKyo is owned by the same owner that owns the next door Chinese Combo place.  And while this might scare the typical sushi afficiando, I challenge you to seperate that concern if you have it.  The sushi here is good and deserving of a visit.  His saba\/mackerel is always good.  He also heats up his unagi\/fresh water eel at a higher temperature than most others.  I think it does wonders for the experience.\n\nHe doesn't make his own tamago tho, he says he's stuck with the wrong tools as he has to share his kitchen with the other restaurant next door, and it's primarily chinese utensils\/cookware and he doesn't have the proper pan for it.  I'm tempted to buy him a few pans just to see what he can do since he's so good with the rest of it all.\n\nHe sometimes makes a \"Japanese Bagel\" which is a single piece of maki-zushi style where there is smoked salmon, cream cheese and crab rolled up together.  I fancy myself as dubbing the name for his creation as I equated it to such when I first ate there.  He laughed heartily at the name and I come to find out he calls it such still as I went a few weeks ago or so and he apparently calls it such today.\n\nI'm still not sure of his name, I need to get him to write it down someday.  But I refer to him as Yama-san and I know that's part of his name and it's also a respectful elder reference used in Japan so I think he takes to the name well.\n\nI think the rice here isn't perfect, but it's good enough.  Usually not as moist\/tender as I want.  But not bad either.  I tend to avoid tempura\/deep fried maki-zushi here as it tends to be a bit oily and overheated.  Otherwise, the rest of what he offers in the sushi\/bar scene seems to be very fresh and very well made.\n\nI always enjoy my sushi here.  My friends have a tendency to be a bit disappointed with the kitchen food.  Service tends to be slow with only one helper even at peak times usually.  But I'm almost always willing to overlook all this as I'm a sucker for sushi.","date":"2006-12-30 06:59:38","vector":[-0.0110190476,0.0,0.0,0.0986666667,0.0]}

What makes this home different from so many other museums is that nearly all of the pieces (incl. furniture, carpeting, dishes, etc) are from the original owners of the house, not just period pieces assembled by some curator.\n\nThe opulence of the home is obvious and the home was a key player in social affairs in Indy late in the 1800's. The fact that the \"Hoosier Poet\" from the \"Golden Age\" of Hoosier literature lived in one place for nearly a quarter century at the height of his fame makes the stories about the place even richer.  The President of the United States (Harrison) dined here.  Mark Twain (Tom Sawyer), Booth Tarkington (Alice Adams & the Magnificent Ambersons), General Lew Wallace (Ben Hur) and numerous authors dined here.  Any given night might be an occasion for celebration.\n\nThe woodwork is stunning.  The baseboard is a foot high.  The doorways in the entry are about 12 feet high in rooms with 14 feet ceilings.  Detailed plaster surrounds the chandelier bases and marble fireplaces in nearly every room turn the functional pieces into artwork.\n\nIf you are planning on taking a group, make an inquiry to see if you can have a visit from \"Mr Riley\" who may read some of his more famous poems.  The actor was a former student of one of our group and we were really impressed with the passion and charm that the presentation added to the experience. \n\nCount on starting with a brief film to start the tour and then moving over to the house.  The only negatives of the tour are that no photographs are allowed inside (postcard photos are available at the end) and that you can only step into each room about three feet.  Although that doesn't allow too many folks to view at one time, our group of four managed to shuffle around and take turns without missing very much.\n\nParking is free on the north side of the street, so approaching from Park Avenue is ideal.\n\nThere are quite a few steep stairs to climb, so keep that in mind if you have difficulty climbing.\n\nReview #221","date":"2017-02-09 21:22:43","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11988]}

The coffee is good and the baked items are good.  This review, however, will focus on the management, as I recently had an unpleasant experience at this particular location.\n\nThis Au Bon Pain has a large seating area, and as I work near by I like to stop in on my way home to take advantage of the baked item sale after 7 in the evening (the redvelvet cupacakes are DELISH!). Recently, while waiting for the sale to start, I was seated in the seating area and a disheveled african man (not being racist, only pointing this out to be descriptive) approached my table. This man seemed not well. He had so many layers of clothes on in the middle of the summer, and his hair was so long.  He was drooling uncontrollably, like a dog, a continuous flow of saliva going from his lips to into the depths of this Dumbledore beard thing.  I fiddled with my phone (thanks Angry Birds!) and pretended not to notice him, hoping he would go away.  Obviously he didn't.  Instead, he TOUCHED MY FACE.  His hands were disgusting (smelled like eggs and pickles blended together).  I wasn't sure what to do, and I was feeling uncomfortable, so I panicked and pushed him to the ground, then got out of there lickity split.\n\nI haven't been back since.  I think the management needs to step up and exercise some control about who they let in their store.  This man could have hurt me, or worse.  My father didn't fight in Iraq to have people like this infringing on my personal freedom.","date":"2012-08-24 16:34:32","vector":[0.0633111111,0.0,0.0,-0.12765,0.0]}

We were greeted at the front door by a guide who showed us just the first floor before sending us upstairs to a second guide; we concluded with a third. All three guides were very friendly and knowledgeable. Now, I love house museums - and particularly authors' homes - and this one was fantastic. The house itself is very modest, especially considering how many people lived there, but it remains very intact to Riley's period. After the tour, I completely nerded out with a few of the staff there and chatted about poetry, literary tastes, and how we teach children about classic writing today. My only complaint, if it can be called that, is the road. Lockerbie Square is a beautiful and historic area, but I was not expecting the bumpy brick road - it was not kind to the car. The good news is that they have a little parking lot.\n\nAs I'm not an Indiana native, my own exposure to Riley was self-inflicted. I do enjoy his poetry and I was hoping they'd talk more specifically about his poems, maybe even recite one or two short ones. I mean, there are lots of historic homes with cool stuff in 'em, but not all of them can boast that Riley lived there!","date":"2011-12-10 16:44:37","vector":[-0.296,0.0,0.1655,0.1516833333,0.0]}
