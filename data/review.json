When the weather cooperates, getting an outside table is a must.  My favorite thing to get here is fish and chips.  The portion is generous and the fish is crunchy on the outside.

It had been 4-5 years since my last visit and I was really looking forward to it.  I had heard of changes made due to new ownership several years ago but I am not sure things changed for the better.\n\nI will start with prices.  They are high, too high for barbecue.  We came on a Sunday afternoon and after we received the menus, I asked if they had a lunch menu.  Apparently, you can only order lunch specials during the week.  A little disappointing since I would really only be visiting on the weekend anyway as I am sure most people would.  So you effectively need to order from the (more expensive) dinner menu.  So what does this mean?  Pulled pork barbecue plate and two sides - 13.99, cheapest thing on the menu - small pulled pork sandwich with a small side - 9.99.\n\nSo moving past prices, when the pulled pork sandwich arrived, I found it incredibly bland even a little soggy.  The fries were okay but it is hard to screw that up.\n\nService was okay but not super friendly. My questions about the lunch menu took a lot of probing to find out why there was no lunch menu and maybe the realization that we were only ordering two pulled pork sandwiches and thus no larger order (tip) was disappointing to her.\n\nI won't be back.  There is so much better quality barbecue in Tampa for better prices.

Every time I come I end up getting something else and never make it to the ribs or the beef.  Their nachos are amazing, especially with pulled pork on top.  And I just cannot leave without eating a whole skillet cornbread.  That thing should be regulated as a controlled substance. \n\nYou might find this odd, but I think of Smokey Bones as one of the better places to get a burger.  Yes, a burger.  I'm not sure if it's because the nachos and cornbread have already softened me up, but I find their burgers delicious.  Especially the Loaded BBQ burger topped with pulled pork and onion rings.  Yum!\n\nAnd the night of indulgence is not complete without the doughnuts.  They come hot inside a bag covered in cinnamon sugar and come accompanied with dipping sauce.  By the time I'm done it really didn't matter I didn't try the ribs.  \n\nOh yeah, I'm a fan.

I feel like frequently with small businesses the less flashy the outside is, the better the quality on the inside is, and Tortas El Guero is the poster child for this saying.\n\nKind of sandwiched in a parking lot between a Home Depot and a Dairy Queen, Tortas is very easy to overlook. It really just looks like a closed old shed that someone may store old lawn and garden equipment in. But behind those walls is something so much more beautiful than your old push mower.\n\nThe tacos are $2.99 each but stuffed to the max. I had the steak and the chicken which were both amazing, particularly the chicken. I don't know what they marinate their chicken in but it's got some heat and I like it. There are probably 10 different kinds of taco choices. They've also got tortas (of course) and quesadillas and I think burritos too (lots of menu options I was a little overwhelmed), and I'm looking forward to trying a chicken quesadilla next time I go. \n\nThis place is kind of a diamond in the rough, very unassuming.

Easily the best tacos in the city. Coming from someone who recently lived less than an hour from Mexico. \n\nThe tortillas are very fresh, and the meat in the tacos is of good quality; out of the 5 kinds of tacos I tried only the steak had any gristle. 2 tacos is a sufficient portion for 1 person, 3 if you're very hungry.\n\nI was impressed with the depth of flavor and amount of meat in the tacos. Also impressed with the amount of guacamole in an order for $2.99. Guacamole was exceedingly chunky and fresh with the perfect amount of cilantro. They were out of the fish, I would have loved to try the fish tacos.\n\nThe Asada had a great sweet marinade to it. The chorizo was very well spiced. Steak was smokey and juicy. The salsa verde is very spicy, nice! I love the cans of fresh coconut juice with chunks of baby coconut in them they have in the cooler. \n\nI recommend calling your order in and planning on eating elsewhere, it can get crowded at rush hours.

I have been there 4 times as of this writing. We like it  because it is sophisticated but very relaxed. The food is always great just like it has been in Broad Ripple for years. The interior is cozy and soothing to the eye with beautifully rich dark colors and traditional white table  linens. Centro is in a great location downtown but you need to take advantage of the valet if you want a totally enjoyable experience during harsh weather. My only suggestion to the owners? Unless the Tour de France is  being broadcast from Europe, keep the tube off in the dinning rooms ... all of them. I understand they were installed for lunch meetings and presentations. That's it!

Overall, I would call it mediocre. I wouldn't tell anyone who already had plans to dine here not to go, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. \n\nOur waitress was not good. That might have colored our entire experience. Maybe if we had a better waitress, we would have had a better outlook on Ambrosia. She didn't smile once, wasn't helpful with any suggestions on dining options and just didn't seem to have much personality. \n\nThe food was ok, but nothing too memorable. We had the Antipasto Misto (assortment of Italian cured meats, cheeses, warm olives) to begin. Not bad, but not great. For the price ($12), there was a lot of meat. That was the best part of it. The olives were not warm. Not a big deal, just don't describe them as being warm if they are served room temperature. Also, only two types of cheese included- wish there was a little more variety. \n\nFor dinner, I had the Spaghetti con Gamberi (shrimp, olive oil, garlic, spicy tomato cream sauce, $17). It wasn't bad, but nothing I would ever recall and actually crave it either. And, the description again isn't accurate- the sauce is just a spicy tomato sauce. No cream in it. Too bad, since that was one reason I wanted it. My husband had the Lasagna. Another reviewer noted that the bechamel sauce was great, but we didn't think so. Shouldn't it have a hint of nutmeg in it? That would have changed the flavor entirely, for the better. It was pretty bland.\n\nWe are disappointed. A table close to us had a different, and clearly better, server... he actually made recommendations, described the menu items, offered freshly ground pepper and actually was friendly. Wish we would have had him... maybe this review would have had an extra star or two.\n\nIf you go, I hope you have a better server and better overall experience!","date":"2011-01-04 01:28:35","vector":[0.1595736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

My opinion has not changed. The food here does not disappoint. We ordered their Extra Crispy Beer Battered KFC and Spicy Seafood Risotto. These two dishes were enough to fill two people and so flavorful!\n\nThe seafood risotto was brought in by a hot pan. Do not touch the handle right away because it's super hot. This dish is more like fried rice using the risotto type of rice. It didn't have the liquidy texture you would expect from a risotto but I was totally fine with it. They didn't cheap out on seafood and put in a good assortment which is fantastic! This dish is spicy but it wasn't overwhelming spicy. I quite enjoyed it and it was a big portion.\n\nThe KFC is delicious as always. Nicely seasoned and crispy. The taro fries are unique and this place is the only place I know of that has it in Edmonton.\n\nThey recently added reservations to their website. So now it's really convenient to make a reservation here instead of calling.","date":"2018-11-17 07:06:33","vector":[0.2001928571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

This place is delicious! I came here for dinner and the service was very welcoming and fast.\n\n I tried the sizzling hot ika (calamari tossed in Korean chili pesto, poached egg and drizzled with black olive emulsion) first. It was bursting with flavor and the calamari was tender and mixed well with the sauce. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to take a picture before the dish was mixed but trust me it definitely looked aesthetically pleasing before mixing. \n\nNext I tried the extra crispy beer-battered KFC. The chicken was crispy, very well seasoned and tasted like the perfect fried chicken. It came with three types of dipping sauce and each one paired well with the chicken. This dish also came with taro fries. They were crunchy and nicely salted. If you like taro, then you would enjoy them. Lastly this dish came with Korean coleslaw and it didn't taste like the usual coleslaw you would expect. It was refreshing to eat with the chicken and the dressing was super flavourful. \n\nOur server told us that their grand opening week is Nov 5-10th and they are having specials with their extra crispy beer-battered KFC so check them out! I will definitely be going back soon to try their other dishes.","date":"2018-10-28 08:09:42","vector":[0.1973666667,0.4588,0.0,0.6486,0.0]}

While it's not the crispiest it does have some good flavor and for a price of $19 that includes taro fries and slaw, it's a decent deal to share. The taro fries for me fell flat but was an instant hit by our child dining guest. \u00a0Jang's take on beef tataki is strange yet something you have to try. First off the beef ain't sitting in a lake of ponzu sauce. This dish is not lost in the sauce, the sauce is solidified into ponzu cubes which is so weird at first but not bad. The Gogi Platter that had 4 different proteins and enough veggies and sauces to make some decent lettuce wraps. \n\nJang has recently opened on Jasper ave and has taken the old spot of Soy and Pepper. Service was pretty non-existent as we had to go up a couple times to get their attention so I suggest getting thos buzzers on the tables like most korean joints. Also they had seated us at the only table where they had a broken light so forgiveness please on the dark photos. \n\nSal says: Just Try It (3.7\/5)\nMatt and Dianne says: Ribeye was T A S T Y with the kimchi butter.

I ventured back to Decatur and visited the 1010 location. The smell is surely intoxicating. I checked out what they had pre-boxed but really wanted to try some items from the case--I have no idea how well pralines keep so I figured the fresher the better. I opted for a pre-packed assortment of goodness for my grandmother as she likes anything sugary. I made my way to the front and checked out the items they had, everything is pretty pricey, I think 22.95\/lb. I worked in a chocolate shoppe as a teenager so perhaps I'm skewed about this as I was always able to enjoy high end chocolate and knew how much we paid for it vs what we charged for it....anyway I digress these are homemade so def worth it. I asked the man behind the counter if he could make a box for me of a few different items, I would tell him what I wanted. He was a bit off, seemed irritated or just out of it. He goes \"well you have to tell me what you want\" yes obviously but thanks for letting me know. sheesh. I got 2 pieces of white chocolate toffee, 2 rum pralines, 3 regular, and 2 coconut. That in addition to my pre-packed box came to around $30. He took awhile to package me and ring me up with my cc, waited until I had been standing there several minutes with my card in hand to tell me I also needed to show him my driver's license. I'm from Jersey, I'm not patient and I know this, but this man was not very awesome---however the candy was so tasty I won't allow it to affect the review. After he rang me up I tore into the box, the pralines really are delicious. Sugary, buttery, creamy.....so tasty. I've been tearing off a little bit each night from the few I brought home.

They have gotten a little grainier since I brought them home but it's crazy they've lasted this long considering I've been  home for a few days. \nI think the candy here is delicious but I'd probably grab a praline from all the different places when I return so that I can actually compare.","date":"2013-03-22 12:59:08","vector":[0.3291285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Sometimes they seemed to change around the recipes for certain rolls.  So we'd really like the spicy tuna roll sometimes but other times it wasn't as good.

I don't know if they still have it on their menu, but the fried ghost roll was really good.  \n\nThe drinks are also really unique and yummy.  There's one with crushed kiwi in it that's very tasty.  It'd be a great place to go for drinks with friends because you'd never have to fight for a drink at the bar, and the drinks are great and never watered down.\n\nFrom my experience Modai is usually pretty empty, but that's probably because they are sort of on the outskirts of the Loop area, so the foot traffic isn't as heavy as other parts of the Loop.  And while it can be a little more pricey than some other STL sushi places, I think it's much better than the other sushi restaurants in the Loop.

Behind the bar area is the slushie machines and they have quite a few to choose from.  They have some regular staples (ie Tiger Paw, Sex on the Beach) then some that are tailored to the area (Louie, in honor of the Blues bear).  There are 3 sizes to choose from, all in different price ranges and they are charging an extra $1 to seal it up if you're going to take it out of their area.  We ordered 3 to go, no one was asked for an ID and continued on our way.\n\nThere are some places to sit inside but this is more of a hot day siting on the patio type of place as there's more room outside.

I wish they had a little sauce sampler upon request as I like to dip into everything.\n\nThe last time I was back I had a beef and cheddar paninni which I enjoyed and the soup was delicious.  The ambiance is cool and I got to meet the designer and also one of the owners.  I'm interested in design in the city and it was interesting to find out they pulled the tin that they used to decorate the inside of the bar from an old rectory which re purposed it from being thrown away.  I'm glad the neighborhood has an interesting place now with good food.","date":"2019-11-19 21:38:44","vector":[0.3957,0.0,0.0,0.3728333333,0.0]}

The owner, Marc, greeted us immediately and made us feel welcome. The restaurant itself is adorable. It has a cozy, comfortable vibe. There is even a table that mimics a picnic bench with some cute dangling lights and a pretend view of the outdoors. So cute! Here is what we ordered at Flannel for dinner:\n\n1. Mac Daddy - this loaf of mac and cheese included 3 generous slices with a crispy breadcrumb topping. Definitely a fan of this, especially if you're a comfort-food lover. The cheese was not too overwhelming, either. It was a subtle blend, but at the same time, flavorful and delicious. \n2. Country Poutine - another comfort food with tons of flavor. The fries were crisped to perfection, no soft or soggy fries. The short rib was also quite flavorful and tender. You could cut into it with just a fork. \n3. Flannel Burger - if you're hungry, this is the burger for you. Our burger came with TWO patties, cooked to perfection. The toasted brioche bun was extraordinary, it definitely made the burger. It was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. We also added avocado and a fried egg on top. The avocado was perfectly ripe, and they were quite generous with the serving of it. \n4. Mississippi Mud Pie - we are both not chocolate lovers, but this pie changed the game completely. This three-layer pie was so moist, decadent and delicious. The large serving of whipped cream gave it the perfect balance. The pie was also sitting on top of some type of caramel\/maple drizzle that added a nice kick to the chocolate flavoring. This pie was to die for!! \n\nWe definitely want to come back to try the pound cake french toast. Overall, this restaurant was a hit in every aspect. The ambience, the service and the food. Would absolutely recommend if you're looking for some delicious Southern-style, comfort food. Flannel is a popular brunch spot, and we can see why. Breakfast for dinner is also a favorite of ours, so we would come back for any meal. \n\n- @Coupleatss on Instagram","date":"2019-12-19 17:58:57","vector":[0.3407333333,0.2732,0.0,0.4195,0.0]}

I'm sure it's mostly due to COVID but I really hope the whole eating outside sticks. I know I've said this to everyone I know.... it reminds me of Europe. Everything was outside. \nThey were playing country music which I consider brave being a city spot. Most people I know living in the city describe their musical taste as \"every thing but country.\"\nSo first off I love the metal cups they use. I really want to purchase one. Secondly the coffee was really good. I totally forgot to ask what it was. \nThen came our meals. My sister got the seitan chicken and waffles. Her roommate got the BACT to the future(Bacon, Avocado, ? And toast) she added an egg. I got the regular chicken and waffles. My meal was excellent. I tried my sisters Seitan and that was super good. However I am glad I got regular chicken in this instance. The chicken was fried but still remained super juicy on the inside. I wish I could cook good chicken like that. I've traveled down south and they know how to fry chicken. \nI really want to go back for dinner sometime. \n\nIf you're around here I highly suggest you check it out.

The concept is Indian fusion mixed with Mexican food and it sounded absolutely delicious. They offer a variety of wraps, burritos, bowls, and even poutine with classic Indian flavors and dishes. \n\nMy partner and I each ordered the super bowl which was such a great deal at only $15 you could choose 3 proteins and a base, and we were completely stuffed.  I got the butter chicken with chickpeas (chana) and saag paneer, topped with yogurt and the medium chutney.  My partner got the chicken tikka masala with beans (rajma) and saag paneer and yogurt as well, but with the hot chutney. The chutneys were nice and spicy and really added a great flavor to our bowls (the medium one was more herby in flavor, the hot was more peppery).  We tried each individually before mixing it all together, and each component was really delicious except for maybe the saag paneer, we weren't too crazy about as the cheese curds were very small. Overall, super pleased though with them! \n\nOur poutine was alright- ours unfortunately came without the cheese it was supposed to be topped with? We ordered a small kids' size just to try it because we were really intrigued, and we topped it with chorizo tikka, jalape\u00f1os, katchumber (cucumber, tomatoes, onions) and pickled onions. The fries were actually really great, nice and crispy and delicious but overall it kind of was nothing special, just fries topped with things. We should have in hindsight ordered a more curry based meat topping to make it closer to poutine. \n\nI would definitely recommend them as a quick bite \/ takeout place, I could see this being a great stop for a hearty lunch for anyone and it for sure gets huge bonus points for uniqueness!","date":"2021-01-24 23:20:00","vector":[0.108592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Also, the baked goods are really good, excpet the red velvet cupcake I bought here (the cupcakery down the street has offically ruined all other cupcakes for me).

I appreciate food for its own sake and would rather prefer a chef who knows how to pair foods within a dish and an entire menu instead of fussing around with ingredients (for the sake of looking or sounding important). It takes a true master to pull off certain techniques without butchering the dish by resorting to over-fattening or over-sweetening. I haven't eaten at enough fine restaurants across the country to be a snob, but I'm definitely a foodie.\n\nThat being said, I was skeptical of this place from before I stepped in. Nice hotel restaurants have that distinct error of catering to the dumb rich guy who likes to spend a lot and be inundated with information so he can feel justified in his purchase. Gimmick and money are his calling cards. I'm not that guy; give me the best without explanation because you know its the best and I should when I taste it. If I require a fancy explanation or catch phrase to \"get it\", then I'm not a customer worth keeping.\n\nThis approach came in spades from our overly kind, verbose waiter the minute he opened his mouth. From the scripted lines to the explanation of food and drink (\"the ice is one sphere so the whiskey doesn't get watery\"), everything was just so forced. It's as if their philosophy is to provide as many one-liners and cutesy items (wooden magnetic clipboards hold menus, etsy-style stamped clothespins hold checks) to make sure their customer \"got it\".\n\n\"All of this is going to be palatable,\" I thought, \"as long as the food is good.\"\n\nIt wasn't. Of the four different dishes and four appetizers my friends and I ate, only two were good. One was downright throw-this-in-the-trash-now food and the others were bad to meh.\n\nTrash: stew. Seriously if I had made this, I would be embarrassed. The only flavor was tomato (which isn't even listed on the menu); shitake mushrooms had too many hard stems, kale came in large, chewy clumps, the rest of the veggies were utter mush, and the shirred eggs looked, felt, and tasted like rubber.\n\nBad: burger. Farm egg yolk broken, completely unseasoned, no moisture (egg would have slightly mitigated this), terrible bun. I HATE doing this...but I had to dip it in Heinz ketchup to make it palatable. And the \"truffle\" fries had not a single truffle taste WHATSOEVER.\n\nBad: steak. The $25 steak tasted like a teriyaki-obsessed mom had cooked it.\n\nMeh: \"Jars\" of jelly, pimiento cheese, and something else unmemorable.\n\nMeh: deviled eggs. Over-flavored with sweet and fat.\n\nMeh to Good: Fried green tomatoes. Still, this dish needs an identity (wait the whole restaurant does).\n\nGood: Shrimp & Grits. Flavors right, seasoned well, fresh shrimp.\n\nFor all of its faults, this restaurant has potential. The room was nice, the lighting was appropriate, if a little dim (we saw someone 15 feet away using an iPhone flash to read the menu), the waiter was nice and knowledgeable, and the concept for the restaurant is one that could, even should, work. The tables and chairs were comfortable and all other items were nice, heavy, and really just right in the I'm-nice-but-not-too-fancy way.\n\nHowever, I will never return on my own dime to that restaurant, and if they hope for it to work on the indiscriminate businessman, their current menu needs major renovation. Unfortunately, this is not likely to happen, as I'm fairly certain their philosophy of coercion through superlative and gimmick supersedes an application (or at least an aspiration) to excellence in food. If this sort of restaurant remains, it points to a continued ignorance among Nashville residents and business travelers.","date":"2013-06-02 21:07:01","vector":[0.0238878788,0.47755,0.0,0.457575,0.0]}

The \"Tennesse Benedict\" was quite good. The oatmeal br\u00fbl\u00e9e was really a br\u00fbl\u00e9ed banana on oatmeal. It was very good oatmeal garnished with very good berries. The crispy potato hash was not crispy and had a peculiar, somewhat metallic taste. \n\nLunch was excellent. The truffle salt on the French fries is a very nice touch, as is the watercress on the burger. The chicken salad sandwich was pretty basic but very well done. The choice and quality of fruit on the side in place of fries was excellent. \n\nDinner was outstanding! The deviled eggs were a wonderful, imaginative twist on the classic. The crab corndogs are something every crab lover should experience. The shrimp and grits is an extraordinary twist on this southern staple. The goat cheese pannacotta was also excellent. \n\nThe prices are high but reasonable.

Do not forget to ask your server for a vocher.  This is a big bonus in my book because it is always gracious of a hotel to pick up the valet tab for their customers.  \n\nThe menu and decor both celebrates traditional Southern cuisine, however it didn't come off as upscale to me.  The menu and decor comes off as thoughtful, well planned with a side of kitsch.  Mason jars make up a majority of the decor.  The rich browns and clean lines make for a relaxing dinning room.  There is a private dining area on the side for larger groups (so keep that in mind yelpers if you are hosting a fun event).  I loved the bar menu, it was a leather bound booklet with a very beautiful picture of a rabbit on it.\n\nI started with the Peach Old Fashioned.  They infuse makers mark with peaches.  The house made hop bitters cut through the sweetness of the peaches making for a well balanced drink.  My friend tried the House Made tonic and gin.  The tonic had a bit of an earthy taste to it.  Once the cocktail was completed, the biggest win was it was Wine Wednesday.  Half price bottles of wine (yes please).\n\nThe appetizer selection was good.  They were out of oysters, but I lived!  The crab corndogs are so good and the jars were a great complement.  I loved the pimento cheese and pepper jelly.  For dinner, I had the Chicken Gallatine with spicy collard greens and a turnip green puree.  All the flavors blended together beautifully and the chicken was very tender.  The Halibut and the Mason's burger were all enjoyed at the table.\n\nLastly, the Elivs dessert was the best.  I am of firm belief that dinner should be chocolate, upon more chocolate with chocolate and chocolate, plus some ofther stuff.  So that being said, dark chocolate mousse, with a bacon white chocolate brittle, peanut butter and bananna jam could have been my 1st, 2nd and 3rd course.","date":"2013-08-04 15:22:52","vector":[0.1425821429,-0.11315,0.0,0.116425,0.0]}

Always a good sign seeing a restaurant able to stay clean in the front of the house.\n\nTo start off we had an order of the Crispy Fried Squid aka calamari. I wish I could have another order! The batter had a nice crisp to it without being too heavy, while also having a flavourful seasoning throughout. The squid inside was cooked excellently with just the right firmness.\n\nWe also has an order of the Grilled Beef Vietnamese Fresh Salad Rolls which were good but if you had to choose just one starter, go with the crispy fried squid.\n\nFor my main dish I ordered the Co Do's Special Beef Noodle Soup. I absolutely loved it! The broth was a nice blend of spicy and sour. Not your typical Ph \u0111c bit. The broth seems to be done in a Thai style, but seemed different enough to still feel unique as a Vietnamese dish. The spiciness of the dish was just right as it did not overpower the dish while still lending the right flavour and a good compliment to the sourness of the broth. The selection of meat and a couple pieces of shrimp definitely made this a much more special type of dish which I felt they pulled off very well. It was a generous helping without being too much so worth the price.\n\nI will definitely find myself returning if I happen to be in the area, or in the case of tonight make the drive up, but I believe the city could definitely use another location south of the river.","date":"2014-08-02 08:53:50","vector":[0.2002615385,0.0,0.0,0.4019,0.0]}

I normally steer clear of restaurants that offer more than one type of cuisine (K-Top offers four!) but we were tired and hungry and the person who greeted us when we walked in and asked to looked at a menu was so friendly and inviting that we decided to give it a try. Am I glad we did! The food was fantastic! We returned last night with another family, and even their picky toddler loved it. Between our two visits we have tried several dishes, at least one of each type of cuisine. Every dish we've tried has been worthy of ordering again. And the service is top notch. When I asked our server if the recipe of one of the dishes had changed from our previous visit, explaining it was good but not nearly as good as the last time, he checked with the chef and then reported back that it had. He then offered to take it back and have it re-made using the old recipe! We took him up on his offer and within minutes he returned with a fresh dish made of the previous recipe! K-Top is also very reasonably priced. I think everything on the menu was under $20. It's hard to recommend any one item because they've all been so good, but I have to put a plug in for the pineapple fried rice, which is served in a half pineapple shell. My only criticism of the place is the way the name is written. The K and the P are so abstract that we literally thought the name of the restaurant was To! Following our first visit we were telling people about this great new restaurant in Chinatown oddly named To. We almost couldn't find it in a Google search when our friends wanted to check out the menu in advance. Despite its confusing name, I sincerely hope people will give this restaurant a try because it is truly a find.","date":"2014-07-28 01:52:45","vector":[0.1306909091,0.67165,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

While there can sometimes be a wait for a table and while it can get REALLY PACKED on the weekend nights, they do move through pretty quickly and it's not a huge deal to hang out at the bar until something opens up.\n\nThe double gin and tonics are strong, and always made consistently: you know exactly how many to drink to straddle the line between pleasantly drunk and unpleasantly plastered. This summer they've also had the Arnold Palmer, which has become my favorite summer beverage and discovery: sweet tea infused vodka (oh. my. god.) and lemonade. They are fabulous, especially if you can manage to snag an outdoor table, enjoying the summer air and sipping on one of these. \n\nAnd although I'm not really a beer person, they have enough available that I can find something I like if I have to, and my more beer snobby friends never have problems either.\n\nHowever, secretly, I like the Bishop's Collar because they have perfect, cheap, unhealthy, fantastic, filling bar food. The plate of nachos is intimidating when sober, but after a night of drinking, sharing it with a friend hits the spot. Their wings are not gristly in the least, and the hot sauce, while not quite the same as a buffalo wing, is tangy and tasty. My favorite thing MAY be the chicken chipotle sandwich, with Old Bay fries, which is an absolute steal for $6, but it's hard to choose. Usually we just end up splitting nachos and wings, because it's hard to mess with a classic combination like that.\n\nBut back to the Bishop's Collar: hits-the-spot food, great drinks, and a nice, low key evening to hang out with friends in the neighborhood.","date":"2009-08-04 14:32:34","vector":[0.1129307692,0.7184,0.0,0.307825,0.0]}

While I know Starbucks is a little more civic-minded than the average mega corporation, I try to avoid giving my business to those types whenever possible.

I recommend getting a hot beverage, as the iced coffee tasted watered down and the cup it was served in seemed to start getting mushy which was really bizarre. \nDo not come expecting anything to eat- this was my mistake not really theirs but this is a heads up to you all the same. There were two flavours of rock hard muffin (cinnamon or lemon) and one very dry and flavorless tiny bacon scone (which I purchased unfortunately for me). \nThe chairs and honestly the entire interior are not ver comfortable.

You can buy a slice and drink for a reasonable price. I love the simple layout in the dining area, benches and tables (cafeteria style). I was looking forward to our visit today, which is why it pains me a little to write this review. \n\nThe first thing that hit me about the place today was the heat, it was hot and muggy in the restaurant providing no relief from the heat outside. In fact, it was a relief to walk out after lunch because we were able to escape the humidity\/mugginess.\n\nWhen we place dour order, the guy behind the counter was a little less than enthused to be there. Granted, it is probably because he had to be there without relief from the humidity in the room so please understand this is not an attack on his character. In fact, when I ordered a pitcher of soda he was nice enough to remind us that when buying a slice of pizza we receive a free drink. I think he did his job to the best of his ability. Customer service could use a boost, but I think that issue would be resolved if they provided a cooler or more suitable environment.\n\nMy bride had a slice with sausage, and each of the men had a slice of pepperoni. The pizza is amazing: great sauce with just enough cheese. The dough is super thin and cooked perfectly, and the flavor and texture are very traditional. It's tough to nail the flavor of New York pizza pie, but these guys take a good run at it.\n\nSo why the 3 stars?  We ordered 3 slices and some garlic cheese bread. The bread was decent, but came out after the slices and I'm a little picky about making multiple trips to the counter for my order. It would have been nice to have everything come out at once. Again, if you've ever read on of my reviews, you know I am a stickler about customer service and even though it is understandable they might be grumpy due to the heat; I'm scoring the store and not the individuals so they get dinged for not providing a comfortable work place as well.\n\nI say get your pie to go but be prepared to wait knowing it will be worth it when you grab a slice. 3 out of 5 is not that bad, you have to almost kill somebody to get a lower score.  \n\nWe'll go back when the temperature outside drops a little.","date":"2014-06-29 21:59:06","vector":[0.3106,0.16846,0.0,0.19102,0.0]}

Just to start off.  I have been going to this pizza joint since the 1980s.  I have decided tonight that I will not be going back EVER!  I ordered in good faith that my food would be tasty quick and served happily to me.  I ordered a medium 3 topping pie with 1\/2 garlic loaf.  I waited up to 4 minutes shy of 1HOUR to get my food.  The garlic loaf was soaked with some kind of butter liquid and a couple of spoonfuls of minced garlic were thrown on the top.  The pizza hand a small amount of sauce then the toppings (ham, green olives and extra cheese) on half then (pepperoni and extra cheese) on the other half.  I had asked about the order and the guy told me it was just going the oven...ha.  It hadn't even been made at that point.  Anyway when I ate the pizza it was raw in the thicker crust part.  All the toppings and cheese slid off the dough.  I asked for a refil of water for my wife,  the guy handed back my cup then said Gatorade got in it and then said, \"do you want me to keep filling it up until it filters out.\"  Really?...sucky pizza, long wait and water with a little Gatorade in it.  It seems like the only thing they are capable of doing is heating up slices and serving them on a paper plate.  I complained and they never said sorry or anything.  Oh I almost forgot the guy came back later and put a cup of water on the counter and said \"here this one is one me\".  I decided then to get up and leave the rest of the pizza there, being raw and all.  I then saw the guy go over and tell the so-called manager and saw the manager laugh!!!  So here is my reasons for never going back:  Bad quality of food, dirty establishment, rude customer service, high price for a piece of plain cheese pizza, long wait.  The good: lunch special is ok.

In fact this restaurant was one of my favourite American chains and I was super excited for when it came to Edmonton! I've been here twice now and have enjoyed both visits. Once was with a larger group that included a baby and I was surprised and pleased that they had bassinet holders available for the table. The other time was as a date night to celebrate my birthday and I truly enjoyed it.\n\nIt is well worth signing up for their email list if only because around your birthday you'll be able to come in with a voucher for free chocolate covered strawberries to come home with from your dinner outing! Both times I've been here have been to celebrate my birthday and it has been nice to be able to savour these strawberries on the days following the dinner out.\n\nMy favourite fondue course is pretty reliably the cheese course. Apples and cheese, bread with cheese, veggies with cheese, each of these go together rather well. The salad options here are rather good and don't have too much salad dressing. The beverage options are limited for fancy non-alcoholic options but I do love having berries floating in my beverage so that is always fun! The meat course is awesome in part because of the adventure of cooking the different kinds of meat. It would be nice if a timer were available at the table to keep track of how long one is cooking the various meats (chicken especially) but smart phones work well. Finally the chocolate courses are yummy but often I am too full to want to eat more! For each of the courses one can get more items to dip in the sauce (or cook in the sauce) which is a nice touch if one runs out of veggies or bread or fruit etc.\n\nOur server was great at my most recent visit here.

This is the first and only location of its kind in Canada.  I had already been to this restaurant in Pasadena on Colorado Blvd.  So I knew what the experience would be like.  \n\nCarolina made the reservation online ahead of time.  It's a shame the restaurant is only open for 7 hours.  I guess since it's still a market test, i can see why it would only be open for that long.  Our reservation ended up being at 8:30.  Pretty late for a normal dinner but I knew what we were in store for.   We arrived about 10 minutes prior to the reservation time and still hate to wait another 15 to be seated at our table.  Kind of reminded me of the same instance when I was in Pasadena.  We were at a private dining area with our own booth in the back amongst the other private booths.  \n\nThey paid attention to details as the reservation stated I has a seafood allergy.  Their theme for the \"Big Night Out\" was France.  It started out with a cheese fondue with bread, veggies and fruit.  Then came a Nicoise salad.  Interesting how \"nicoise\" was spelled out.  There must be some real dumb Americans and Canadians out there when a menu item has to be dumbed down.  \n\nAfter that was the main course with was the basic Fondue Feast.  The website http:\/\/www.meltingpot.com\/upload\/menu.pdf didn't display the French items but the only difference was the Duck a l'orange. We had substituted the shrimp with andouille sausage.  The reduction was a Coq Au Vin.  The waiter explained to us the cooking method for each of the items.  Can't forget the mish mash of dipping sauces it came with.  Only bad part was that he gave us the seafood sauce but we could have asked for a substitute.  All of the meats were marinaded to perfection with the duck being my favourite.  It wasn't too gamy and I think the marinade was masked that gaminess.  \n\nFinally came our dessert which was the creme brulee.  It was partially made to order with the caramel bits and the flame afterwards.  We had graham cracker crusted marshmallows, cheesecake, brownies,  and fruit.  I mean it didn't REALLY taste like creme brulee, but it was still delicious.  \n\nSo the only knocks I had aside from the modified creme brulee was definitely the location of the place.  What review can't be without coming from an urban planning perspective.  It is located in the far reaches of the south side of Edmonton only accessible by car.  If you don't slow down you would miss it.  The one benefit of the Pasadena location was that it was on the very walkable Colorado Blvd.  I mean it is a popular place, well suited for Downtown but I suppose cheaper rents was the deciding factor.  If you live in the Northeast or Castle Downs you better make a night of it and expect a long drive home.  I would definitely recommend the experience but its location kills it.","date":"2010-10-18 05:00:39","vector":[0.1059238095,0.0,0.0,0.1998,0.0]}

Been saying Chinatown Square needed a good burger or pizza spot for late night munchies.\n\nI came here on Sunday with a group of friends for their Memorial Day combo special where you can choose any Classic Burger and get a rolled ice cream from I.CE.NY for just $10.  I tried to get their portobello burger, which is clearly listed under CLASSIC burger, and they wouldn't give it to me.  It was only $1 difference from the cheeseburger. I asked if I could pay the difference and the manager refused and wouldn't give me a justified reason why he couldn't accommodate.  What if vegetarians wanted to participate in this promotion special? Obviously they can't because we were only allowed to choose from the hamburger, cheeseburger, chicken burger, or chicken cheeseburger. Also, my friend ordered a classic cheeseburger and tried to add extra toppings (bacon and fried egg) and the manager said he couldn't get the free ice cream bc he added extra toppings and it was no longer a plain classic burger. Where does it say the promotion is only valid on a PLAIN classic burger?? It made no sense since adding toppings would mean we are paying more for the free ice cream!! \n\nNow onto the burger itself.  I ended up getting the chicken cheeseburger since they wouldn't allow me to get the portobello one.  It was bland and not seasoned, but the chicken was cooked well and was still pretty juicy and tender.  I would say the quality is like a burger from a backyard bbq. Nothing special about it.  My friends got the hamburger and asked for it medium rare and it came out medium well. He said it was dry and also bland. \n\nBecause of the extremely poor customer service we got from the manager, I would not come back here.

There was a s'mores-like creation with delicious real marshmallow. A popular standard, dark chocolate salted caramel, was also available and so well done here.  a truffle and a brittle rounded out the options, both fantastic.

I have never tasted a \"Plain White Layer\", as one of the layers was just that, and yet it tasted like heaven in my mouth. \nHer flavor creations of the layers were incredibly delicious and she is truly gifted when it comes to the tasting of the cake. As I continued to eat and eat this delicacy, in my mind, I kept thinking, \"I don't think any cake company could compete with her on that point\". The cake tasted just sooooo good!\n\nTHE NOT SOOO GOOD:\nUnfortunately, as we started to get closer to the date, her communication began to get shady. I warned my sister about this. I could care less if I had to demand for my deposit back later, all I wanted was for her wedding cake to go smoothly. My sister was adamant about sticking with her and giving her a chance. She had just given birth and was re-settling. I won't bore you with the communication details at this time. \n\nDay of the wedding. She texts  that the cake, would be delivered when the reception was 30 minutes prior to start or 30 minutes prior to our dinner open. This way, she assured us, the cake would be \"Safe' as she didn't trust it sitting alone with waiters walking around and no one really attending to it. Ok, this made sense, I suppose so we went with it. So, 30 minutes prior to my sisters reception, there  I was, waiting... NO CAKE , NO GRACE!  We called her and she had all sorts of excuses why she was running so late. The parking garage entrance was changed, traffic, etc. She said that she had called the restaurant to let them know she was in route...restaurant was super professional and I was right there at front desk...well of course...they denied her ever calling all day,  like she claimed to, but whatever..\n\nAt one point, she told me \"Im, in the car, I'm mustering the strength to bring your cake in\" I was like WHAT!?? frick! I WAS CALM BUT FREAKING OUT! My sister was due to walk into the restaurant any second! NO CAKE!!!\n .  \nI told her multiple times I would walk down and help her take cake in! I WAS DESPERATE TO GET THE CAKE!  Finally by third phone call, she is at the correct parking garage and I RACE through the casino, to the parking garage, to meet her.  Literally,. She lifts the cake out of her car, out of her car, and  carries it in. No cover no nothing! Just, mid-air through a crowded casino!  My sister and I escorted the cake and her through the hotel.  I was daggered anyone,  who stepped in her way, worried they may make  her TRIP!  Oh my goodness!  We had to walk, with an open cake, as my sister carried the cake topper, I cleared the path, as we crossed steps, the crowed casino , lines , etc just to get it to the restaurant. VERY STRSSFUL!\nThe cake could  have been wheeled in  on a cart maybe? No wonder she needed her strength!. Her previous comment made perfect sense now. \nHer final excuse for the tardiness of the cake.??.Apparently the wedding before us, had given her the incorrect address to their location, which set her behind schedule  to us\"  Our cake ended up being an HOUR  late ! \nWe were very lucky that my sister ended up taking longer with the photographer than expected or else the cake would have arrived at the time she was already seated. My sister arrived within 5 minutes of the cake being delivered\n\nThe cake itself looked like it had been put together in one hour or less. It appeared unpolished and lopsided. I cannot post pictures, unfortunately. . Perhaps,  most guests didn't notice but we sure did, and it was my sisters wedding cake, and for her, the cake is an important visual element in her wedding. I chose Grace Bake Shop because of her artistic ability in her cakes. She assured me that she designed and created all her cakes. CLEARLY she hadn't done this one because this cake shouldn't be in her portfolio. It looked like a beginner level cake. \n\nMy advice for Grace: You have had great reviews in the past. Your cake taste great! You definitely need to cut back your orders or be perfectly honest with the client two days prior or even a day prior if a crisis or emergency occurred in your life at the time your cake was due. Easily we could have found a way to re-book with another bakery as my sisters design wasn't all that complicated and yet the cake turned out looking sooo \"Amateur\" and clearly not resembling anything close to your photo gallery.","date":"2016-06-20 17:17:04","vector":[0.1898888889,-0.0833333333,0.0,-0.0664454545,0.0]}

Not a speck to be found. I honestly didn't even try it since it looked so gross but my friend did and said it was way to garlicky (and we like garlic). I tried some of their fries and they were absolutely the most disgusting fries I have ever tasted. They tasted like freezer-burnt mccain fries. I actually didn't know it was possible to have fries taste that bad. Ugh.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nice enough. Nothing special, but there were lots of open tables on the random weeknight we went.

We had a particular vision for the cakes and she combed through each and every detail with us and went back and forth until she had all the details we wanted perfectly laid out.   The finished products were jaw-dropping and the comments about the cakes just kept rolling in.  Everything was exactly how we wanted them to look and they tasted even better.  Meg is a perfectionist and it shows in her work.  If you choose her to do work for you there will be no doubt that she is going to give you every penny worth of what you are paying.  The best part of it all is that we now get to gorge ourselves on the leftovers.  Thinking about how much work she had to have put into everything just makes me tired.

It was a tough choice - the website lists many flavors that sound delicious, along with vegan and gluten-free options.\n\nI was amazed when I saw the cupcakes - they were adorable.  Each of the raspberry frosted cupcakes was topped with a perfect raspberry.  Not only were they good looking, but they were delicious!  I've got high standards when it comes to baked goods, and these were among best cupcakes\/cakes I've ever had.  They taste like my mom's home made cakes but look like something out of a bakery.\n\nMany people at the baby shower (several pay grades above me) wanted to know where they came from.  There were positive comments on both presentation and taste.  One woman said you could taste the quality of the dairy in the frosting.\n\nSummary:  Meg's cupcakes were amazing and made me look like a rock star at my boss's baby shower.","date":"2012-05-21 16:41:51","vector":[0.34608125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I went by and the shop has two counters, one for phone repair and one cashing checks and such. The person for phone repair wasn't there so I was going to go somewhere else, but the person at the other window actually called the repair tech for me and I spoke with him on their cell phone. He asked me what was wrong with my phone, what kind of phone it was, etc, and then told me I could go ahead and leave it with my name and contact info since he would be back soon, and he would do what he could with it and call me (on my moms phone) when he assessed the damage. I figured why not, it won't turn on anyways, I'll walk over and hang out in the French Quarter, hopefully it's not crazy expensive. \nEnded up only costing $60 for him to replace the charging port and fix my thumbprint sensor.

Also, it came with house-made sauce, pickles & onions and a drink.  The 'Server' also brought out a packet of plastic spoon, fork and knife.  With one napkin???  So much barbeque sauce and just one napkin???  Also, none of the staff were wearing any mask(s), we are still in the midst of a pandemic.  I thought the cooks, should have at least wore some sort of mask(s).\n\nAnd for --  DESSERTS  --\n'Banana Pudding'\n(vanilla wafers, whipped cream)\nIt was half a pint, served in a plastic to-go container.  You can also get a full pint for additional $4.00, for a total of $8.00.","date":"2021-08-03 04:49:58","vector":[0.0388521739,0.0257333333,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Cookies and biscuits included. Added cornbread and the banana pudding to try and an extra 1\/2 pint of Mac and cheese because weren't sure how hungry the kiddo was, but the original deal was plenty. We had leftovers of everything 2.5 of us). \n\nI'll preface by saying we will definitely be ordering again. \n\nPick up was quick. Ready within 10 mins on a Friday at 5 pm. Food was warm when we got home. \n\nBrisket. So so good. The fatty part just melts in your mouth. I don't know how much to say it but the brisket was just so good. \n\nSauce. We did classic and the sugar free. Honestly, we didn't like either, the sugar free was like tomato paste? I don't know, but not a fan.  The classic was fairly vinegar-y and my husband want a fan. I'm not even mad about it. Know why?  That brisket was so good I wouldn't advise putting any sauce on it anyway. Even if the sauce was good I think we would skip it. Like why is sauce even offered for this, it's offensive to the meat. So much flavor and melts in your mouth. There was an option for no sauce and when ordering I thought \"who would order no sauce?\". Next time, we will that's who!  For real. Just get the brisket, skip the sauce, and watch your life change before you. \n\nSides. Green beans were great. Everyone loved them. Mac and cheese was great. Nice and creamy, I do like when you get that cheesey crust on top, ours didn't have it but didn't notice much till after because it was really good. The coleslaw was OK. I like mine a tad sweeter, so added a pinch of truvia on the leftovers and it was perfect for me the next day. Horseradish was enough to taste but not enough to make you cry. Would order all these again or maybe try something new. Or stick with it. Who knows. \n\nBiscuits. My husband hates biscuits. Didnt think that was possible like who hates biscuits? Not this southern gal. But man, did he finish every last bite. So fluffy and big. Great flavor. I don't even know what was on top of it, butter? Honey? Both? Don't know, don't care. Delicious. Get them. \n\nCornbread. It was cornbread. Nothing special. I'd get the biscuits over the cornbread. Whatever the spread they added, my kid ate up all the way. Not sure what it was, but it was good. But those biscuits were on point. I'd pass the cornbread for the biscuits for sure. \n\nDesserts. The cookies were super gooey in the middle nice little crunch on the outside. Pretty perfect. The banana pudding my husband loved and he's pretty picky with banana pudding.\n\nOverall. Loved it. Great portion. Great deal. 2.5 of us and it was definitely enough for 2 meals with a little extra which I love as well. Nice to have a bbq nearby!\n\nP.s.

This place is the real deal! Now, being a Philly native and having lived in and visited a couple of different cities domestically and internationally, I am ALWAYS on the prowl for good food joints. And with all the foo foo spots that Philadelphia is opening, it is great to see that Paul's is thriving well amidst all the chaos.\n\nSo, yesterday, coworkers and I visited Paul's. We got cheesesteaks, BBQ wings, and a chicken sandwich. This was one of the BEST lunches that I have had while working in this part of downtown. The cheesesteak I ate was just how I like it: lots of meat, cheese, a bit of mayo and fried onions (it ain't a cheesesteak without fried onions). I was in heaven for all 10 minutes that I enjoyed that bad boy.\n\nFrom now on, it will definitely be a go to spot for me. Planning on getting some cheese fries from there later this week. For the price, the serving is huge. I saw a couple of other people order some while we were there and I am excited!

It's been on my pho radar for a long time now and I checked it out with my husband and another couple last night.\n\nWhen I opened the menu I was surprised at the prices for pho compared to other neighbourhood pho joints I frequent. $9.50-$10.50 for a bowl. I ordered a meatball and brisket pho. I was disappointed that the hefty price tag did not accompany a hefty bowl of soup. It was similar to a small at other restaurants, and they only had one size here. The taste was good, but there was hardly any meat and I was still hungry afterwards. We all ordered green onion cakes to start and found them a little too greasy and crispy. The sauce that came with them was nice. \n\nService was ok. Our waitress was nice but got really confused when we were ordering. Seems like the kitchen guys brought out our food and they were pretty smiley dudes. Friend asked for some more lemon sauce and a coke and they only brought the sauce, so he had to flag them down for the drink.\n\nThe tables are pretty close together.

It is warm, clean and they serve up pretty damn fine food.\n  The service is not terribly attentive, but this is, like many noodle joints around town, is a family enterprise and as such you are not dealing with professional servers and staff. Many times, your server will look like he doesn't want to be there at all, and he likely doesn't, but orders are taken quickly and the food arrives in good time. If you need something extra, you are going to have to ask for it, but I have no issue with this.\nYou can tell the real attention is being paid in the kitchen... that is where my interest lies.\nThe menu is varied, and being a neighbourhood place they also serve up some standard Chinese dishes, which are quite good, but I am here for the Vietnamese fare.\nI usually go for the Pho, which I love. I like that they serve a slightly smaller portion than some other places, which leaves me more room for green onion cakes and salad rolls.\nThe broth here is very nice, clean and clear, and it compliments the ingredients well.\nPho broth is one of those subtle elements that varies slightly from place to place, based most often on old family recipes. This one keeps me coming back.\nThe key to good Vietnamese cuisine is the freshness of the ingredients, and Pho and Bun understand that well. The vegetables, the meat and even the noodles are always fresh and delicious.\n\nAnyone who reads my reviews knows I love this cuisine, and I frequent a lot of different noodle shops.\nIs this the best in town? No... but it is well up the scale for me, and I eat here quite often. With the varied menu, I also find it a good place to bring friends who may not be that adventurous. Thiose who are frightened of tripe and tendon find familiar ground in lemon chicken and fried rice and maybe... just maybe... I will get them to try a bite of the tendon and bring them over to the tasty side.","date":"2018-08-26 22:11:56","vector":[0.2715384615,0.33525,0.3612,0.0,0.0]}

The pork tastes like real pork, rather than that off-putting mystery meat taste that's so frequently found in Oriental restaurants. I always do pick up, and it's ready very fast (10-15 min).

The first time it was delivered, they brought me the wrong refrigerator. Then they brought me the right one but it was damaged. I ended up settling for another model since I had been without a fridge for 2 weeks. It was such a hassle. The manager ended up giving me a floor model at a discount but it has given me nothing but problems. Well. Fast forward to yesterday when we were supposed to get a new dishwasher. Yes. I was hesitant but the husband wanted to order with them because they said it would be delivered yesterday. We went to Home Depot, Lowe's, and another appliance store in Tucson to compare and because we could get it faster and get Best Buy rewards points we chose to give Best Buy another chance. We even got a confirmation call from the driver the day before. Then, yesterday afternoon, my husband received an email saying it would now be delivered on Friday between a given time window-you know the ones. \"You have to be home between 8-12 or 1-5 to get your item delivered\". Mind you, I was the one home all day yesterday waiting for this delivery. I adjusted my work schedule to make this possible. So, you can imagine the inconvenience of being told that 1. Your item isn't coming. 2. You have to be available for this time we set. Gee thanks Best Buy. My husband called to speak with the manager and was very kind. I am ok with that, but I will say. I'm very dissatisfied with the lack of customer service. Nobody could tell us why we weren't getting our delivery and that they'd flag our order and keep a watch on it. Gee thanks for watching it.

The food is authentic and very well executed.  There is good variety on the menu, even the English one.  The decor is classic old school Chinatown and the service is attentive, helpful and welcoming.  Portions are generous and priced like any other restaurant, so they're good value.  Their clientele is the local Chinese community and it's busy.  There is probably no better endorsement.\n\nAs with all North American Chinese restaurants, the best food is often off the English menu and seasonal specials are often only written in Chinese.  Ask the staff about what's good and what the chef found for the specials.  Depending on seasonality, there might not be a special every day but it's worth asking.  \n\nThe reality is that most western diners order the \"Big 3\": fried rice, sweet and sour pork and Ginger Beef, over and over again; something that convinces Chinese restaurant owners that the average western customer is not interested in authentic Chinese food, which is why the English and Chinese menus are not really the same. So, ask.\n\nTheir big challenges in attracting a wider customer base are the dearth of parking in Chinatown and that the neighbourhood intimidates some.  Western diners also find a room full of Chinese all speaking Chinese loudly a little bit intimidating as well.  Although parking is a challenge, both the neighbourhood and the restaurant are really quite welcoming in reality.  Come in a group so you can order a wide variety of the dishes and have a raucous good time like everyone else.","date":"2010-05-26 01:13:51","vector":[0.27514,0.4008,0.6486,0.29095,0.6369]}

We ordered a fairly typical traditional Chinese dinner which included deep fried squid, steamed chicken, lobster in cream sauce, steamed fish, soup, Beijing pork chops and beef with Chinese greens. I would say the best thing on the table was the steamed fish and squid. I was really disappointed with the lobster, which was unfortunate as this is one of my favourite dishes when we go out for Chinese dinner. The cream sauce was way to excessive and bland and they didn't add any extra garnishes or anything to it. The noodles underneath were also kind of spongy and just didn't taste right. \n\nDecor wise, Sai Woo looks pretty run down and could probably use a revamp. I feel like I read somewhere that it's been around for awhile and the inside definitely looks that way. Service was also pretty poor considering it wasn't busy at all. No one really checked on us (minus a hot water refill for our tea) and no one changed our plates mid meal. Considering how slow it was there was no reason for the poor service. Like I already stated, the overall consensus from the table was that dinner was less than mediocre and none of us will be going back there any time soon.","date":"2016-06-01 04:58:20","vector":[-0.0037647059,0.0258,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

So overall I'm middle ground. The decor is snazzy pants with swank looking marble everywhere. and the fact that it's an underground basement bar is kind of cool, but it also sucks because it might end up being a no cellphone zone like it was for me.\n\nJL Sullivan's is semi formal sports bar, so it brings a swanky side that most other sports bars don't (or would never) offer. So fans of Strikes Lounge and it's formal bowling might be right at home. But traditionalists will find themselves screaming. All of it's 12+ TV's were also tuned to one channel. I didn't really have a problem since I could still roll casual, and wasn't vested in any game. But with so many element's of swank, dive, gastropub, and sport's bar to it, JL Sullivans looked like a bar that had no clear identity. All I could figure out was that it certainly wasn't a legit speakeasy.\n\nI was here because my friend won an incredible Happy Hour package. She was a VIP sipping on fine champagne infused with elderberry, and her friends who came enjoyed 2 hours of all you can drink domestic beer, house wine, and well drinks for $15. They also had discounted appetizers for it, But from what we had they were pretty average. The fries came in a swank looking metal dish designed like a big martini glass, But they tasted like Wendy's fries.\n\nOverall It's pretty good for the occasional beer, especially since it had a well rounded offering. But it's superfuntastic for those Happy Hours and they have sign ups for them pretty frequently.","date":"2008-11-30 01:29:43","vector":[0.4539111111,0.16665,0.0,0.2849285714,0.0]}

I had the chicken parmesan with a side of two (huge!) meatballs.  Everything was wonderful... couldn't have asked for anything except maybe a little more elbow room (kinda cramped, but it's an older place so whatever...)\n\n2nd - Lunch - Went there today for lunch and was severely disappointed.  I had the fettuccine alfredo which was ok but nothing special.  It was VERY small though... I actually thought they had mistakenly brought me the side order.  For $13 I expect more than a small bowl of pasta.  My wife had the grouper with a side of spaghetti.  It was also ok, nothing special.  The spaghetti sauce was very good, the highlight of the meal by far.  For dessert we had the \"homemade\" tiramisu and wished we hadn't bothered.  Dry and average tasting.\n\nOur server (Nicky) was also nothing to write home about.  She provided generally distracted service and just overall didn't seem to care.  She never asked how everything was, handed us our check without even asking if we wanted dessert and acted like us being there was a bother.  We got there at the end of the lunch hour so I guess her customer service ended with lunch.\n\nSo now I don't know what to think of Iaria's.  I accept that places have bad days\/meals\/servers and today was certainly that type.  They have one more chance.....

I was so sad when Mexicali closed; it was one of my favorite restaurants in West Philly and I ate there regularly, and there's nothing really to replace it (Honest Tom's, to me, while good, seems a completely different genre of Mexican food).\n\nI'm glad a restaurant opened up here, but I don't feel like it provides as much to the foodscape of the neighborhood, as there are already a lot of good Korean places around, and I eat Korean enough that I'm starting to get a bit sick of it.\n\nAt any rate, entrees run around $9, and I'd say they're cheap because the portions are HUGE and the quality is good.  I've eaten here several times, and tried the bibimbap, denjang jigae; yuk gae jang, soondooboo, and some other dishes.\n\nMy one disappointment is the side dishes--they only bring out two side dishes: kimchi and pickled radish, sometimes they've only brought out kimchi.  Even the food court in North Philly (which is considerably cheaper than this, and has food just as good) always brings out at least three side dishes, and most sit-down restaurants in a similar price range will bring out 6 side dishes for a party of 2 and often as many as 8 for a party of 4.\n\nThis place is also very low on space and tends to be very crowded.  We tried coming here once before, relatively early on a weekday, and there was no space.  When you get a seat here, it's full of hard surfaces and gets VERY noisy.  I think they'd do well to hang a few tapestries or do something to put a damper on the noise.  I found the noise level really detracted from my enjoyment of the place.  It's so cramped that the noise makes it seem chaotic and grating how many people are packed in here.\n\nAlso, service can be a bit spotty.  Once they forgot the side dishes.  Often, they seem to be a bit overwhelmed.\n\nMexicali that used to be here, which I thought was an excellent restaurant, was often empty, and now this place opens up and is instantly packed.  Why is there so much more demand for this type of restaurant?

My husband and I both ordered ramen bowls. I had the black eye bowl with the \"zamen\" option (zucchini noodles) and my husband had the basic bowl. We carried out to our home down the street In Fletcher place.  The packaging for take out ramen works great. The broth is separate than the other ingredients so you combine it when you get home. Sadly, neither one of our bowls had the soft boiled egg-my favorite part of ramen-and we both ended up with black eye bowls, mine did, however have the zucchini noodles.  The broth is VERY SALTY.  Now ramen is in and of itself salty, we get that, but this is a bit over the top. Everything else was great. I love having the zucchini noodle option. All other ingredients were super fresh and tasty. Staff was very upbeat and pleasant despite it being rather busy on their first Friday night in business! We love to see local business thrive and will definitely be back to try other items on the menu.

We came for the fried chicken dinner and went all in with \"The Whole Damn Thing\" option, which means what it says...you get everything on Duke's very succinct menu. A whole fried chicken, three (3) large sides consisting of hatch chili pepper mac & cheese, a cheesy tater tot waffle, and a fried brussels sprout salad for $35.  I knew the meal was special because I didn't have to season a darn thing, beyond using the honey-hot sauce on the chicken.  All the sides were excellent with great flavor balance, I'm not certain how I could narrow it down in the future.   The roasted brussels sprouts were balanced with chunks of apple, pistachios, and pickled red onion.  Although the cavatappi-shaped mac & cheese wasn't my preferred crunchy topping version, the peppers helped cut through the gooey sauce. Bless the creative soul who decided to put tater tot mix in a waffle maker; the crispy pockets intermixed with the soft potato bits and sour cream topping...heaven. We had tons of leftovers, so thought the price point was reasonable. \n\nBeer-wise, they offered Lone Star and other cheaper lager options. For the craft beer person, there was also a small selection of choices. We were lucky enough to visit while they offered all the Upland Teddy Bear Kisses stout variants and split a flight of tasty imperial stouts.  The place was formerly the Ice Box and the new owners have kept the red-lighted dive feel, while scrubbing the bejesus out of the place and adding a few atmospheric improvements here and there (such as updated bathrooms).  Yeah, it's a country music and honky tonk bar, if that's not your thing...but at least a majority of the music leans towards old school country.   I highly recommend visiting Dukes.  The new owners are LGBT+ friendly and are hosting creative events (like cooking schools, LowPone, Girls Pint Out, etc.), mixing modern sensibilities with the old school honky tonk bar feel.  If you have a problem with any of the above, please don't visit because none of us newer Duke's fans would miss ya.","date":"2018-12-10 23:03:00","vector":[0.0150615385,0.0,0.0,0.2678888889,0.0]}

He told us which scotch and wines to try and bought us a round which was very kind and generous. He told us that if we wanted to try any wine from the cellar that they sell by the bottle to ask for it by the glass- for 2 glasses he would open the bottle and simply charge us by the glass! The bartender was his nephew. He was a wealth of scotch knowledge which we both appreciated as we are not scotch experts.

While I'm a fan of breadsticks, the idea of being limited kind of bothered me so I opted for the pizza deal and settled in. \n\nI will admit that I always chuckle when I see the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. I'm in a wheelchair. I don't wait. But, bad gimp humor aside, it feels particularly weird to see the sign in a restaurant with only a few customers and no particular method to their madness. However, an employee did seat me in a timely manner after the usual stumbling through \"Where do I seat a wheelchair?\" look on her face and an awkward question of \"Do you want me to move a chair?\" I was tempted to mumble back \"Do you want me to dine here,?\" but I resisted the urge. \n\nThey took my drink order, the usual unsweetened iced tea, and I eyed the area with the buffet - essentially a warming area with a handful of different pizza types on it. The majority of the types were of the thin-crust variety with a couple fairly weak attempts at deep dish amongst the options. I would love to tell you the topping varieties, but I have to be honest and say that with the way they make their crust I had a hard time distinguishing the toppings. Fortunately, the pepperoni and sausage options were fairly obvious and I tend to be a rather basic pizza diner. \n\nI can honestly say that everything about Monical's screams out average. If I were a pizza, this is where I'd go to experience a comfortable retirement. (I know. That made no sense. It made me laugh). The decor is stylishly bland (Yes, it exists!) with about four wide-screen televisions on the wall and overhead music playing Hootie & The Blowfish (shouldn't that be oldies now that Hootie has reverted back to country crooner Darius Rucker?). There's a nice effort to build in some privacy for diners with booths that have higher walls\/boundaries, but the overall decor left me looking around practically begging for something to look at (Fortunately, there was one exceptionally cute employee). \n\nThe pizza is decidedly average, though I did enjoy a nice lasagna dinner on a previous visit. The warming area is definitely not wheelchair friendly - it's a tad high and I noticed that the warming seemed uneven with some areas not much more than warm and others downright hot. When I arrived, plates were also not out and that made things a bit confusing (this was quickly resolved). \n\nI did get my usual iced tea refill - yay! \n\nThe location is on a corner of what is Glendale Town Center and is right around the corner from Macy's. The entrance is an odd choice as it's not the closest door to the primary parking options for the restaurant. It's not a long walk at all, but a user of a wide wheelchair would be unable to use the sidewalk because there's only a small path outside a small outside dining area. Therefore, they'd likely have to travel in the street to get to the entrance (which is also on a slight slope). \n\nMonical's isn't really what I'd call \"good,\" but it's also not what I'd call \"bad.\" It's a decent enough option if you're in the area and craving pizza and this is especially true since the nearby Pizza Hut\/Taco Bell establishment is now Taco Bell only. At $7.99 including drink, the buffet is a decent but not stellar value (far better than the overpriced Marco's buffet set smack dab in their abysmal atmosphere).","date":"2015-01-02 19:38:39","vector":[0.11885,0.5095,0.0,0.1230928571,0.0]}

From there you go to the mixing room and see all the tanks.  After that you head back to the brew house and get your last sample.  The last sample is a real glass about 20oz of beer, so choose wisely.  \n\nOverall, a good tour with two free beers.

While you wait for your tour you can grab a bite and beer and roam around the lobby or chill at the Biergarten - an excellent outdoor spot.

Inside Lee Lee's International Supermarket, there is a small shop where they serve the traditional Chinese BBQ duck and pork. The pork choices are either roasted (served with the crispy skin\/fat) or barbequed, which is what you see at many Chinese restaurants. IMHO, the best way to eat any of these items is straight out of the oven, sliced up, and layered on plain white rice. I go to Chinese BBQs in Chinatowns (Sam Woo's chain) in California, and Nan Tian's BBQ is very similar, maybe just a bit more expensive here. Also, they use a lot of star anise in their BBQ pork, which takes away from the natural pork flavor.","date":"2016-10-30 22:00:49","vector":[0.1606142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I have seriously gone to Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket at least a dozen times already and did not notice this little store inside the market. Just right behind of the cashiers too! You cannot imagine my surprise when I saw it right before my eyes. I was so excited, I stopped in the middle of the walk way and took pictures of it to send to my sister back home. She knows how much I love authentic Chinese BBQ and was even going to bring some from Orange County for me on her next visit. You don't get this type of BBQ at Chinese restaurants, but you must visit these specialized stores. \n\nWhat else is great is that if you don't feel like cooking rice at home, you can either order a side of rice or order a combo plate that comes with your choice of BBQ meat with rice. Personally, I buy a package of uncooked vermicelli noodles at Lee Lee, boil the noodles at home, and eat it with the roasted pork. \n\nTip 1 : You can request them to slice the meat for you into smaller pieces, so you don't have to get your hands dirty at home. Cutting the roasted pork can be a pain, especially if you don't have a badass butcher knife like theirs. \n\nTip 2: Bring cash because they are CASH ONLY. If you do forget, just buy something inside Lee Lee, as they offer cash back from debit card purchase.\n\nTip 3: Ask them for sauce that goes with your BBQ choice!","date":"2013-10-08 07:37:29","vector":[0.0464571429,0.0,0.0,-0.056575,0.16635]}

I suit up because I'm a gentleman but I've seen people get in with the trashiest clothing I've ever seen like shooters quality of attire.

We stood there at the front for about 2 min trying to find out if we was suppose to be seated or take an open seat so we ended up taking an open seat. Then a server or the cashier came up and gave us a menu so we thought he was a server. He just told us if anything just ask him and so yes duh we do have questions it was our first time here. And so we sat at the table for a good 15 min until we was told we had to order up front. We walk up front when other customers that was siting next to us as are we supposed to order upfront since it was her first time here and I told her I guess since we all was waiting for about 15min.

I was skeptical and hesitant at first because it appeared to be a vegetarian joint. But I noticed you can \"add a side\" of either chicken and\/or bacon, so I felt that I'd probably manage. It's not that I HATE veg food, more like it tends to be very bland and I feel like most veg food I've had lacks that flavor factor. Aside from Gokul. That place kicks ass. I never miss meat there!\n\nBut anyway, decided I wanted to order the Tom & Ginger which was a drink they had on the menu at Le Coq and while it wasn't on the menu at a Good Man, they were still able to make it for me. Well apparently, there was some kinda fancy homemade ginger puree in it that they no longer have, but the waitress said they could try to make it for me anyway with what they had now. Well unfortunately it ended up tasting awful; one of the reasons why I enjoyed that drink so much was due to the fact that it tasted like a mojito. I tend to hate gin anything, so needless to say when I sipped the makeshift version of the drink I apparently made a face. She took it back and I requested the drink Cherie had instead which was the Little Flowers. It was pretty legit, so I stuck with it. I guess the ginger puree really masked the gin flavor because the past drinks I'd had were beyond awesome.\n\nOpted for the 4 courses for $35. Only it wasn't $35. There was an upcharge for something, apparently (mushrooms?) I almost got the cheese plate for dessert but they also wanted an extra $10 for that. How does that even make sense? It should have only been an extra $5 or so or else the 4 for $35 deal wouldn't make sense depending on what items you picked...you'd actually be best not to do it. Ended up not getting it because of that. However, I liked that we could pick the chicken side as one of the courses, that was cool. \n\nI got the vichyssoise and like Sarah S., I was expecting it to be served cold. It was warm, and wasn't too bad. Creamy without being too rich. The chunk of onion in it, though, was hard and kind of gross and added nothing extra to the dish. Could have done without it. It came with gnocchi in the center which was awesome but there were hardly any in there. I wish there had been more.\n\nI ordered the squash dish as well and it was only okay but hardly any food at all. I liked the fried crunchy thing that came with it and the balsamic-tasting sauce. Good balance there. If they hadn't included the sauce, it would have been wayyy bland. Still kind of a letdown considering it would have been a $9 dish otherwise. I didn't think it was worth it. \n\nTried some of Sarah's cauliflower risotto and I almost spat it out. Probably the most disgusting, bland dish I have ever tried in my life. No joke. She seemed to dislike it as well. Cherie's tagliatelle wasn't bad but it seemed a little on the bland side. I couldn't try the other thing she ordered because it was wayyy spicy apparently.\n\nAlso got the mushrooms which were delicious but again, hardly any food at all. I wish I could eat a whole bowl of those, they were so good. Kind of buttery. Mmm. Great flavor. Criminal that it's $15 for these though.\n\nI also had the chicken but it was no where near as good as it was when I had it at Le Coq. Kind of a bummer. I wonder if they changed the marinade? Either way it was odd tasting and was probably the source of my stomach pain after.\n\nSean ordered the bacon and it was absolutely disgusting. It was SO thick that it was more like beef jerky instead of bacon, and when I bit into it, it tasted as if someone had dumped an entire shaker of salt into my mouth. I wanted to spit it out so badly but didn't want to seem gross so I drank water and tried to chew as fast as possible. Ew.\n\nTried some of Sarah's ice cream & was pretty good...I loved the edible flowers.\n\nOur bill came out to be $100 with tip. Kind of overpriced IMHO for the quality we received. I left feeling bloated--with a huge stomachache (despite hardly eating much)--and an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. Sorry guys, but I don't know if I will be returning to the next installment from entre. Le Coq was the absolute best, and it kind of just went down from there. A Good Man was only okay, and Agrarian (in my opinion!) was just a let down. \n\nAnd the hostess did ask us to leave the table so another party could sit down. We were planning to leave anyway, but it was still kind of rude. I don't think I'd ever have the balls to do that to someone. I get that others wanted to have our seats, but can't you let me zip my fucking wallet up and close my purse before you come over and ask me to get up? Jeez. It was evident that we were planning to vacate shortly. If it hadn't been for that encounter, this review would have been 3 out of 5 instead of 2 out of 5.

A pizza station, a salad station, a prepared-foods section, a homestyle station (which changes the menu daily). You can also buy chips, yogurt, granola bars, and the like. I used to like that the salad bar was self-serve and sold by the ounce. This is no longer the case and it's also pricier.

Unfortunately, as I arrived I quickly found out that Heartbreaker isn't opening up until 4pm these days - so, I dejectedly headed next door to check out Landlocked. \n\nAs was previously true, this building is fairly wheelchair friendly. They've tried to adapt to the pandemic by renting out PODS to allow people to dine safely outside (I think this is primarily Strangebird). It takes up 1\/2 the parking lot. However, there are two accessible parking spots and a curb cut directly in front of Heartbreaker. Landlock has a two-sided glass door that's a little heavy but not bad. You go in, masks are required and social distancing enforced, and there's a counter to your right and a handful of booths to the left along with a sort of sofa\/table in the middle. Heartbreaker also has tables in front of it outside similar to those that were at The Mug. \n\nThey have a small printed out menu, there's a photo of it in the photos. Essentially, they are known for their pastries, coffee, hot drinks, and a handful of cold drinks. They also have some breakfast sandwich type options. It's a relatively small menu. I'd read multiple raves about the chocolate croissant and got some hot chocolate to go with it. \n\nThe decor inside is like a cousin to Strangebird, sort of a tiki-lite with an emphasis on casual comfort. There's a single user restroom that looked accessible. Interestingly enough, they don't really have any tables that are accessible - all the tables are taller except for one - the sofa\/coffee table arrangement. That table is rather low and designed for lounging with the sofa. I have a feeling this layout is their pandemic layout. \n\nThe employees were friendly. They offer a rewards club if you enter your phone number. Today, they were noted as only accepting credit cards. I have no idea if this is a regular deal. \n\nAs I recall, the chocolate croissant was around $3-3.50 I think. The hot chocolate was priced at $4.50, which strikes me as absurd since you're getting about 12 ounces. My total bill was a bit over $8, which strikes me as pricing for the neighborhood. \n\nThe chocolate croissant was definitely a delight, though possibly would have been better heated up. It was bagged up. I took the croissant and hot chocolate and sat at one of Heartbreaker's outside tables. The hot chocolate, as you can probably tell from my tone, was definitely not worth $4.50 and I would not order it again. \n\nOverall, this was a solid experience and a great opportunity to support an up-and-coming Indy business. They emphasize their pastries and their pastries were top-notch. Business was steady, but people were being respectful of space and each other. I even had a customer open the door for me since I was carrying hot chocolate. I've always liked the Irvington area. \n\nI can easily go 4-stars, but with the overpriced hot chocolate and lack of a wheelchair option for tables I'm not able to go up to a 5-star. That said, I'd easily return and will return the next time I'm in Irvington. Hopefully, it'll be a time when I can also check out Heartbreaker.","date":"2020-12-05 21:33:38","vector":[0.07414375,0.31245,0.09946,-0.0620642857,0.0]}

They also have chips (some weird brand with a rapper's face on them...kind of strange), gooey butter cake, and soda.  My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which he didn't like that much, and while I liked the grilled cheese, it was kind of basic.  What set it apart was the sweet flavor that came through every few bites, probably from the bread, and it was cooked very well.  The dipping sauce was marinara, which I found to be quite odd.  I love the concept of a dipping sauce, but who wants marinara on their grilled cheese?  I would love to see them add a pesto, aioli, garlic butter...that would definitely bring me back.  Also, how about some fries or something?  Some people don't like rap on their radios or on their potato chip bags!\n\nI'm a big food truck supporter, but overall, the experience was just ok for me.

Kind of like a Christmas tree, on steroids.  The bar area and interior are covered in bamboo, with green walls.  It does look like you're in some jungle.  As long as you don't mind the weird lights.  The plates they use are also strange and multicoloured.  \"Tacky\" comes to mind again, but it does fit the theme.\n\nThe 16oz steak I had came with onion rings (too much batter), and a nice dish of sauteed mushrooms that didn't seem too sauteed at all.  The steamed vegetables were a bit plain but that was easily fixed with some salt.\n\nMy colleague ordered a shrimp salad, but the shrimp came severely undercooked.

Today, I finally had the chance to swing by and on a day that was +34 outside, today was the perfect day! \n\nI ordered the cereal milk soft serve which tastes exactly like it sounds; like milk tastes after you've added honey nut cheerios or corn flakes. It reminded me of childhood, haha, and also slightly reminiscent of the soft serve at Milk Bar! It is a fun pastel blie color and comes with a butter cookie on the side and topped with condensed milk and graham crackers! I like the texture and crunch the graham crackers added. The condensed milk was for the most part undetected because cereal milk is pretty sweet on it's own! \n\nThe super fun aspect of soft serve at 720 Sweets is that the ice cream comes in a cup over dry ice, so there is a bit of steamy smoke-like effect and theatrics! It doesn't change or enhance the flavour of the ice cream in any way, and the steam doesn't last very long, but it sure is a fun to be served an ice cream with steam emanating from it \n\nThe girls at 720 Sweets are quite friendly and helped me make the final call when I narrowed it down my picks down to two!

I waited almost an entire half hour for them to give me my food (which had been sitting on the counter for at least five minutes - I saw them pick it up). Shame on me for not opening up the takeout containers before I left. My boss ordered the shrimp and chicken with the oriental and the noodle salads. What she got was a cucumber salad and an empty space in the takeout container. Fortunately, I had ordered the oriental salad, so put mine in her container so I didn't have to go to her with a completely incorrect order. Super sucky.

But I'm very disappointed to tell you that this place has inconsistent quality and when you're playing $70 for a meal for 2 people, that becomes unacceptable. We always ordered the striped bass with the Sichuan peppercorns and it had previously often came out delicious leaving us craving for it week after week. But this Friday we ordered our usual and it came out to be this watered down mess (the fish didn't taste all too fresh). It's like they diluted the Sichuan sauce with plain water so the fish was boiling in water when Sichuan sauce is supposed to be oil based. The skin is also soggy when previously it was nicely grilled charred. I voiced my frustrations to the waiter and they were able to make me a new dish BUT the new one came out tasting the same as the previous one. Not sure what is going on -- if they changed chefs or whatnot but I am so disappointed and will not be coming back.","date":"2018-01-27 01:26:49","vector":[0.114025,0.003,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Although the space is larger, for some reason I got a sense that they had a smaller selection than the Artisserie in University City.

I visited on a Sunday afternoon, though, so I might have just come at an off time. \n\nThe space is very large and could be beautiful, but it feels like they need to do a little rearranging. The sugars and milks for coffee are across the cafe from the register, and the table\/shelf thing they are on is kind of awkward. There is a large upstairs that I did not notice until I was seated - I'm surprised that the space hasn't caught on with the student crowd that filled the Barnes & Noble and La Colombe cafes I passed on my way there. \n\nI wasn't too impressed by the desserts and coffee today, although based on prior experiences when this was a Naked Chocolate I'm still hoping it was an off day. I had the tiramisu, which was small and tasted a little dried out, and had WAY too much cocoa powder on top. The coffee tasted a little burnt. They had placards on the table advertising a Sunday tea service for $25\/person with sandwiches, scones, muffins, and desserts, which looked interesting. I'll head back here at least once to see if the desserts come back up to what I'd expect from them.","date":"2011-01-23 21:15:27","vector":[0.2167777778,0.0,0.0,0.2843333333,0.0]}

Instead of the Classic hot chocolate, this time I ordered the Hawaiian. What a mistake. Someone please show the staff how to make a cup of hot chocolate. Was it thick and creamy as I remembered? Sure! But there was so much lava salt in the petite cup that after a few sips, the chocolate was inedible. I was told that the owners parted ways and this place became Artisserie Chocolate Cafe.

First time here and I was NOT disappointed in the food or drink. Caesar salad was fresh, lemony and had anchovies(yeah). Sand in my Shorts is a great drink. We got the Baller Boil Platter. It was hot with heat and dang hot with spices. My sister & I silently wondered if the spice was too much. We were both pleased that we could settle in and enjoy it. Loved it all. Corn was fresh (yes I know when they have that frozen crap). Sweet potatoes in a boil was a nice touch. White Potatoes were cooked just right and did not have too much spice. The crawfish and shrimp were spicy & very good and the crab was sweet but still spicy. Loved the Turkey neck too! No complaints on the boil once I settled in and got used to the spice level. The chili butter at the base of the platter was one of the best I have had so far.  The lemongrass and herbs in  boil was a nice touch. Remoulade dipping sauce was really good and felt homemade. Service slipped a little when it got busy but overall pretty good. Definitely going back to check out the rest of the menu.

But I know they just opened so I'm really hoping it improves because it has a lot of potential! \n\nFirst, the space is very nice and they have tons of outdoor seating. Their courtyard and porch is wonderful. \n\nWe got two cocktails. I got the cucumber one (can't remember the name) and it was very good! Really liked their drinks. \n\nThe appetizer options leave something to be desired. We ended up getting the onion rings which were fried great but were pretty spicy (and this is coming from someone who loves spice). The dip they came with was also extremely spicy and vinegary which I didn't like. \n\nSpeaking of sauces, all their sauces were disappointing and didn't really match the flavor profile of what you're eating. Most had a very vinegary taste. We also got the fried seafood plates and they served it with a vinegary green sauce which was just awful. Honestly wish they just had the basic tartar and cocktail sauce. \n\nThe fried seafood was hit or miss. I will say the shrimp were VERY good and VERY fresh. Reminded me a lot of how my mom cooked them. And they had that sweet taste that I've only ever eaten from fresh Louisiana shrimp. The catfish wasn't as great. Very muddy and kind of soggy. seems like there wasn't enough breading or it wasn't fried long enough. I didn't eat my filet. \n\nTheir options for sides were also disappointing. Your entrees don't come with sides. And It was weird to me that they had fried seafood without French fries. We ended up getting the cheddar biscuits which were pretty good, but just wished there were more options besides slaw, cucumbers and potato salad. \n\nIt's also a bit pricy for what you get in my opinion. but kinda expected that given these are the owners of Margies. \n\nI'm interested to try their boiled seafood next time and hoping that with time they'll improve!","date":"2021-05-20 14:21:32","vector":[0.1160416667,-0.07655,0.0,0.21075,0.0]}

The boiled crabs were very small, but full.  They were out of large (and apparently medium) size.  The flavor of the crabs with the chili butter was OUTSTANDING.  But all the meat stuck inside all the claws (over-boiled)?  I'm a New Orleanian and I know how to pick crabs :) The \"tools\" given didn't work for eating small crab claws.  The \"butter\" knife had a very large round end, so no way of using to dig out the stuck meat.  We were still hungry so shared an oyster plate.  The very, very small oysters were DELICIOUS.  The dipping sauce was DELICIOUS.  The problem was it was 6 tiny oysters for around $18.  No way a meal in itself.  It would have been perfect as an $8 appetizer.   Super friendly staff, great vibe.  Really good food.  This restaurant has a LOT of potential, and I would give it another try for the crabs alone.  I hope they up their game.

I only recently stopped by for a second visit and this is, hands down, the most quirky bar in St. Louis.  I think the comparisons to City Museum are accurate.  It seems like the place was just kinda thrown together from the estate sale of an eccentric liberal arts professor in 1972.\n\nI didn't get the chance to try any of their food but it looks like they have a good selection of carribean items.  The clientele is exactly what you would expect in a place like this.  Dreadlocks, tattoos, piercings, and the like.  No worries though, the bartenders are all great and nobody will look at you weird if you come dressed liek Alex P. Keaton (and I would know).\n\nMy only real complaint is that there is usually a cover and it gets loud inside if a band is playing.  It's worth it though.

It doesn't have the most bold flavor, but it's not horrible or offensive.  \n\nTheir milk\/sugar bar is kinda lacking.  No honey, no blue sugar substitute, no stirring sticks (unless you consider a straw a stirring stick, which I suppose you can).

Two weeks ago LOS was at the Navy Yard. Now I have been patiently, ok, eagerly anticipating their return to the Navy yard after missing them at the last Fall Thursday Lunch Truck Lineup at the Parade Grounds due to a last minute meeting. They were scheduled to return a few weeks later, but they had issues with the truck two weeks in a row, and I felt as if I was just an unlucky soul. Two weeks ago my anticipation turned into anguish after sitting down to eat my burger.\n\nFor starters, the fries were $3. Now I am in no way a penny pincher when it comes to food but, the fries were the same size as a small order of 99 cents value fries from Wendy's. I am not going to dwell on that, because it is what it is; not a real deal breaker. \n\nThe issue that really made me was the fact that my burger was way undercooked. The sign says burgers are cooked to medium unless another temp is requested. I prefer my burgers well done but, I have eaten medium burgers before. This hamburger was nowhere near medium; it was completely raw. It was as if the patty was completely frozen then tossed on a really hot grill that only cooked the exterior; barely. I could have taken the uncooked portion of that burger and made a meatloaf because it was nothing but uncooked chopped meat. In addition to the burger being undercooked, the bacon on the burger was also raw. My burger was undercooked on my second visit as well, but not as bad as my last trip. Not only was this burger disgusting, but extremely dangerous to eat. What a complete let down. \n\nThe only reason why I am giving them three stars is based upon my other experiences. I was ready to downgrade to two stars because nothing pisses me off more than going hungry because I spent my money on a crapy lunch.","date":"2013-12-29 00:44:52","vector":[0.02849375,0.0,0.34,0.0429,0.0]}

It's a 3.5 star rating for me. \n\nWhat we ordered\n\nWe ordered a pad thai and their 3 treasures hand drawn noodles. The pad thai was a little too over flavored- spicy with a big salty punch and there was sweetness. Definitely drink some water down if you're ordering this dish. I thought their 3 treasures hand drawn noodle was better flavored. It is not complex like the pad thai with its ambitious balance of sweet, salty, spicy, and umami. It's a delicate balance between delicious and overspiced and in this case, I guess it's why this place is called \"Spice C\", this is a little overspiced. \n\nThe 3 treasures noodle was chewy and had a more clean flavor- flavorful, oily, and salty but none of the sweetness and spiciness that other dishes had. Definitely a good pick for someone who's not into complex flavors and wanted to try out a pan fried hand drawn noodle dish here in Philly Chinatown. 9.99$ for both dishes was a fair price - following in line with the other restaurants around with comparable fares, quality, and price. \n\nService- Service was a little ghost like.

Worst experience bar none in my 46 years on earth clearly Bob Evans missed the boat on picking the right locations to close in Indianapolis and left this poor excuse for a place to eat open to irritate diners unlucky enough to stumble upon it. First it was my unfortunate call to have my wife stop by on her way home to get food there. \nApparently they pay no attention to detail at all, my chicken and noodles came out of the bag as gravy on a biscuit and mashed potatoes, we got no rolls even though we were extorted to pay for them, not sure why they were not included. Didn't get my sons pancakes from his breakfast platter. My wife goes back not a short drive either to get the food items they never gave us. \n\nThe asinine person wanted to reheat the wrong items and add the chicken and noodles-f@&ing unbelievable. Still got no rolls did get the pancakes. \n\nThe poor excuse for chicken and noodles should be re titled as noodles and gravy as there was no chicken in the noodles.\n\nI would strongly urge you to stay away at all costs. I have again eaten at 100s of restaurants and never encountered such incompetence complete lack of any customer service and piss poor food in my life. To make up the incompetence I believe they offered a loaf of bread, my wife said no that's not gonna work. Supposedly we might get a gift card, I doubt it. But do I ever want to return hell no.

We had seen ads on Facebook and we scoped out the menu and it sounded amazing. We decided to come here for restaurant week which proved to be a huge mistake. It all started to go wrong once we ordered cocktails. Save your money! The cocktails were not only watered down but terrible. We decided to try the local wine. Again, save your money because the wine was so sweet it tasted liked grape juice. We finally went to a foolproof option and got beer. Now onto the food. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps and cod fritters to start. We had read that the cod fritters were great from past reviews.... they weren't. They were bland and tasted like tempura batter.\nThe chicken lettuce wraps were bland as well and the lettuce was too soggy to even hold the chicken in there. Again, it was bland. \nNow for the entrees. We got the bibimpop and the fried whole snapper. Again both dishes SUPER bland! The snapper was $10 extra by the way. It didn't even have salt or pepper and didn't come in a sauce so it was hard to eat. The bibimpop wasn't very tasty either. We requested more \"spicy sauce\" just so it was palatable. The flavor seemed off in an indescribable way. It wasn't authentic or pleasurable to eat. Our waitress asked us if we would like to take our leftovers and we quickly responded with a hard NO! \nDessert time. They explained the dessert as a strawberry cake with a whipped topping. Seriously it was a god damn Betty Crocker strawberry cake with vanilla icing and it was delicious!

She NEVER came back to check. I had 1 more bite and it was so disgusting I didn't eat the rest of my entree but she would never know. The bus boy came by and took my full plate of food and my waitress couldn't be bothered. I paid for 3 courses, none of which I liked and 1 of them that I DIDN'T EVEN EAT!

This weekend while my Mom and Charlie were visiting, we had a chance to dine here. The dinner was my thank you for all of the hard work around and on the house, and my good friend Quinn met up with us.\n\nThis unassuming spot is right off South Street. They have a decently sized bar with a surprisingly good beer selection. I started off with one of my favorites, Bell's Two Hearted Ale, and then moved on to the wine that we split as a table; a nice white out of California.  In addition to the beer list, The Latest Dish has a good selection of reasonably priced wines. I really like the decor and atmosphere of this place. Pounded brass tabletops are complimented by the action of the open kitchen in the back.\n\nBefore we ordered, a loaf of bread with pesto olive oil was brought out. Mom loved the olive oil. As another starter, we ordered calamari. The perfectly cooked calamari came with a spicy chili sauce. This was a great way to start the meal. Mom doesn't love calamari, but even she enjoyed the appetizer. Even as a meat eater, she went with the vegan burger made up from black beans and mushroom. The large, crumbly burger was excellent, and she was really pleased with it.\n\nI ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which came topped with caramelized onions, blue cheese,\nand bacon on focaccia. It was huge, and I probably should have saved half for lunch the next day. It was too tasty to stop. The fries on the side were great as well. Charlie's chicken tacos were great. The side of guacamole was creamy and  well made. The tacos were small, but they're really intended to be a starter.\n\nTaking after their name, The Latest Dish has a great selection of specials. Quinn ordered off of the specials list and got a crab cake. The presentation of all of the dishes is great, and hers was no exception. She was happy with the dish, but it wasn't as flavorful as everything else I sampled.\n\nBottom Line: I really like this place. It's a great space, the beer, wine and food menus are all varied enough to keep me happy upon multiple trips. It's a great place for dinner, or just a drink. It's one of the best restaurants around for the price range, and the service was great.","date":"2010-05-25 15:33:29","vector":[0.17824,0.6249,0.6249,0.3142875,0.0]}

We were greeted promptly from across the room by the bartender who told us our server would be out shortly. After the friendly server took our drink orders, the food and beverage manager appeared in a puff of smoke to take our meal orders. I think he was bored. Like I said, it was pretty slow when we went in. From the time we walked in to the time we ordered our food only ten minutes passed -- if that. We even had to turn the server away once because we hadn't decided what to eat yet.\n\nI ordered the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes and a bottle of Canadian. The steak was cooked as I ordered it -- well done. This can be the test of a restaurant's suck factor -- how well they listen to the customer. Well I'm happy to say that the Aqua Restaurant passed the suck test. (Or failed it, however you want to look at it.) I'm trying to say the steak was good. They poured my beer into a glass which was above and beyond. I don't mind drinking it from a bottle.\n\nMy only gripe is about the prices. The food is expensive and we probably wouldn't have come here if we didn't have the Groupon. The service is relaxed and friendly and the food is good but it isn't worth what the restaurant charges.\n\nThe layout of the establishment is wide open. It's within full view of the hotel check-in desk and the lobby. There was an Asian girl in a black bikini waiting for a cab with her friends in said lobby the night we ate there. (Did I mention it's January?) My wife guessed that they were on their way to a party at the waterpark at WEM.\n\nSo if you like to eat in subdued, quiet restaurants or if you have a fetish for scantily clad Asian girls - you gotta eat here. If you`re interested for the second reason then make sure your back is to the bar. Oh yeah, there`s a bar too.","date":"2015-01-25 04:48:07","vector":[0.0457222222,0.05464,0.4019,0.16758,0.0]}

For today I will address their wide variety of sandwiches, from egg salad, to clubs.\nA particular favorite of mine is their A&B sandwich. This is a combination of Italian cold cuts and cheese served cold on a nice roll, this is a big sandwich and could easily be 2 meals. It is served with generic potato chips and a nice crisp dill pickle. This sandwich is so full of its contents that it is difficult to fit it into your mouth. \nCome for breakfast or come for lunch, either way you won't be disappointed.

The main dishes were very good--my only complaint is that they were a little over-salted for my taste. I had the short rib\/mushroom agnolotti and they were delicious. My son had the scallop pasta special which was also very tasty, and my husband had the snapper special. Highly recommended. Go soon because I suspect they will be very busy very soon.","date":"2018-08-20 01:40:32","vector":[0.4591,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I would expect that they would refund my money and learn their lesson and create a contract for future use, update their website and call it a learning experience. \n I hate leaving bad reviews, especially for local, non-corporate businesses because I want to help promote small businesses (as a small business owner), but I would never argue with a customer the way that I have been argued with, especially with no leg to stand on. Bad reviews mean nothing to them because I filed with the BBB and Consumer Affairs and still nothing was done and when I finally decided to offer the package to a friend like they initially offered and suggested, I was asked to retract my BBB complaint and my answer was NO WAY because I SHOULD BE REFUNDED. \n The time and energy I have had to spend on this is ridiculous, especially when I am in the middle in a big move to another state. \n You get what you pay for here - you want inexpensive, fast pictures with zero customer service, then come here.

I was given the responsibility of picking a good restaurant for my friend's 1-day welcome back party (which was also a sorority meet-up which was also a friends sisters birthday celebration.) Using Yelp, we picked Giordano's due to the relative proximity of a karaoke place nearby and were hanging to sing our hearts and full stomachs out.\n\nSuccess! (Mostly luck, actually.) Upon arriving for our 8PM reservation of 10+ people, I noticed a sign off the side of the restaurant that said, \"1\/2 off dine-in pizza on Tuesday.\" And it just so happened to be a Tuesday. Whoo hoo! \n\nReminder: GO ON TUESDAYS! (for 1\/2 off pizza pies!)\n\n\"Less than 14 bucks for a 14\" pizza...? Even for the 'Supreme'?! With sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, AND onions?? Fantastic! We'll take 5 pies!!\" (Really bad idea since a large pie is 8 slices for a total of 40 slices and NO ONE ate more than 2. Leftovers galore...)\n\nBecause I'm a born-and-raised New Yorker who has tried the authentic stuff in Chicago & absolutely fell in love with deep-dish pizza, I'm gonna say that the food was alright but filling.\n\nHere's the downside: Service was pretty slow. Took 10 minutes for our server to show up, 5 minutes to get our drinks (mainly water and soda) and 45 minutes to get our pizza. An hour of waiting. Sad. =( My suggestion is to reserve your seat AND order your pie in advance. \n\nWould I go back here again? Maybe to introduce this type of food to someone who never had it before. Food was decent for Chicago-style pizza in Tampa, I'll have to give them 3 stars. If not for the surprisingly below-average service, it would've been 4.

It's a chain, and looks like it inside (I think it's the overabundance of 'local' chicago art; they're trying to hard). A decent glass of chianti was less than five bucks, and an awful looking and tasting cobalt blue martini was poured for one of our companions for around seven, I think. Service was slow and friendly, but they were making the pizza from scratch, so all is forgiven.\n\nThe pizza. That looming, triple-stacked monstrosity of everything bad for you baked up so good. We got pepperoni in this one, even though we were supposed to stick to cheese, because overkill should never be left half-finished. \n\nIf you haven't had Chi-town pizza, it's enough to make your heart skip all the rest of its beats. Crust, cheese, cheese, cheese, meat, cheese, crust, sauce. There's no folding these slices, they are obstinate, perhaps obscene. Accordingly, they are delicious. \n\nI ate one slice and a half and, about five minutes after we left, was hit by a freight train of food coma.

When I say I literally order here at least 2 times a month over 5 years  and I have never had an issue with this place but one time and now I'm banned from ordering. I'm just gonna run down my situation real quick. I order a large pizza and a cheese steak one day and was told it was a 45 minute wait which I didn't mind because I was home getting ready to leave in about 2 hours. It took over a hour to get to me still no problem. At the time they had a deaf driver that I was unaware of because again I always order here and that has never happened. I called looking for my food and was told the driver already came to my house and I didn't answer through text. Mind you I was getting ready and I didn't have my phone in my hand but I would've heard it if it had ring. I asked why didn't the driver call me like they have always done and at that moment she told me the driver was deaf. I than asked her well he could've knocked on the door. Because my food was already paid for I paid over the phone with a card. She said she don't know and that I could get a refund, so I said ok I'll take the refund because now I'm about to leave my house. I didn't think that my house would get banned from ordering at a location I've been ordering from for years because I was unaware of their new driver and his conditions. And I felt like I was not at wrong for any of it. Maybe a better system from them due to them having some one with a disability. I can honestly say I salut that man for working during the pandemic. But to banned me from something like that is crazy. I wasn't rude or anything, I'm always nice and always tip! But it was nice doing business.

Friday we went to Noble Pie Parlor in the Summit Reno.  We were welcomed, and told it was first come first serve, no reservations. We as a group that night of 17 sat outside by the fantastic gas fire-pit in the shape of our great state, Nevada.  We were all able to fit around it, and sit our drinks and pizza on the edge of it. It was a bit chilly outside, but nice and warm by the fire.  The service was phenomenal. Fast, friendly and helpful. We ordered at least one of every kind of pizza, and every one was to die for! Hot, fresh and flavorful. We ordered different types of mixed drinks and all of them were wonderful. Several pitchers of beer and it was fresh and heady. A great go to place that we will frequent often. Thank you Noble Pie Parlor for welcoming us with open arms and serving the finest pizza and drinks in town! And the fire-pit...is Awesome! (And yes! One of our group was a former musician and singer in The Beach Boys for over 20 years!)","date":"2021-04-12 18:57:34","vector":[0.2702,0.0,0.0,0.4982,0.4588]}

There were 3 tiny rib bones in the box. Needless to say this is not what I was used to being from south Florida where they were a common restaurant. Now let's get to the staff. When we got there one girl was working the register. Her name was Chasity and she looked as happy to be there as someone waiting at the DMV. She took our order. Handed us a buzzer and she was done. Maybe she was mad because there were about 50 people in line and she was the only person on the register. There were about 20 employees there total. 3 of them were just standing around doing nothing but complaining and taking about how they can't wait to get off to \"turn up\".

And the place was empty (outside of the employees of course).  Ummm, no.  But thanks for being open!\n\nNot a problem, we were seated, only to discover that their happy hour only runs 3:00pm to 5:00pm.  5:00????  On a Friday?  Downtown?  Seriously, that's bull.  We were looking to nibble and that option was gone.  So, we went all in and had dinner.\n\nOne plus is that the menu offers half and full sizes, so you can have the quasi-tapas experience.  Or you can get a big steak if you wish.  Based on our appetite, we went with some smaller plates.\n\nRavioli, Buzara (Croatian scampi), ground lamb skewers, and the mushroom tagliolini were ordered. \n\nThe ravioli were the best - had a nice rosemary Manchengo Bechamel.\n\nThe buzara was disappointing -- the sauce tasted boozy (I swear it was made with vermouth, but it was probably just wine) and in a way, it tasted like the sauce had separated into its various components (booze, lemon juice, garlic, etc.)\n\nLamb skewers - super disappointing.  Lukewarm and almost didn't appear to be cooked all the way.  And the mint yogurt sauce had this weird \"dry\" feeling about it.\n\nMushroom tagliolini - Lukewarm as well.  Certainly wasn't worth the $15.\n\nService was attentive, and despite being 2 of 3 customers (there was another table of 2 that came in and left, I think because they weren't happy with the vegetarian options), it wasn't overbearing.  Though the manager (?) came over and asked if I'd like more soda when eying my half empty Jack & Coke ($10.50 a drink)\n\nAnd bonus was the wine prices.  Just your general 100% markup, which is certainly better than some places.\n\nI'm not sure how\/if this place is going to survive.  Which is too bad,  because the view is quite nice.  Oh, the chairs.  They're metal Design Within Reach metal \"bistro\" type chairs.  Which would be great if we weren't paying white tablecloth prices.

I put my spoon down after I realized that I was actually forcing myself to eat it. \n\nThe oven-roasted mushrooms weren't any better. What they call a 'small plate' was really just that: an anemic 5 tablespoons of sliced shiitakes, topped with a few dots of goat cheese.

Mine was spinach, radish, a shaved hard cheese, and, oh dear, a citrus vinaigrette?  I forget what she told me.  The portion was sufficient and it was fresh and tasted great.  Uncomplicated, simple, well-presented.  I also had a glass of wine, something white and slightly effervescent.  It worked well enough but was not a $10 glass of wine.  \n\nMy dining companion had the grilled chicken sandwich, to which I would ask: what are melted onions?

I love the design and location of this place overlooking Citygarden. It looks so European that I had fantasies about a fabulous cup of coffee and a wonderful piece of fruit tart.

After doing so for brunch on a Sunday, I've concluded that this must be one of those tourist-oriented business models where quality is bad and prices are high but people will go for it because of the location. The prices are absolutely ridiculous, even more so for the quality. $12 for a piece of asparagus\/goat cheese quiche. Ok, for the location I could accept the price IF it was a delicious, well-prepared meal. But it wasn't. It was ok at best. I paid $2 for two pieces of Wonder Bread toast, and had to ask for some butter. Coffee was ok until the cream curdled in it. Eggs a la carte were oily and salty. I could go on and on. The french toast was good, but again, $12. One of the beautiful things about St. Louis is its affordability. An unreasonably priced restaurant with average-not good food does not fit into the St. Louis culture and it certainly does not do justice to the awesome experience of spending time at Citygarden. Our server was a very nice guy but seemed very busy, and hence was pretty slow, for a place with so few tables.

Things started out okay but took a turn for the worse fast.  We ordered herbed wings, crispy duck and the beef salad.  Twenty minutes goes by and no wings, at all.  The place was nearly empty so we asked if there was a problem with our order.  Apparently not the thing to do at all as some sort of fried wings were rushed out to us that did not appear to be \"herbed\" in any way shape or form.  The gracious attitude of our hostess disappeared as well and she was now rather callous and acted as if we were a nuisance suddenly.  My beef salad was good as was the duck but neither could save the abysmal service and poor attitude of our waitress.  I would only eat here again if I called something in for take-out, overall a very poor experience.  I will also mention that the removal of the partitioning makes the place feel cold and like you are sitting right on top of everyone else, there is no sense of privacy or intimacy at all.","date":"2013-04-17 03:18:10","vector":[0.1021,0.2023,0.0,-0.2023,0.0]}

I came in around 3 (during a normal lull) and was alone. The server turned out to be the chef\/owner and I loved her. She was sweet and charming and an excellent cook. \n\nI was even a bit annoying because I came in with a groupon and wanted to try to get some type of deal worked out for maybe a combo-ish type plate. I didn't succeed, and I don't really blame them lol but I had to try. Thai doesn't heat up that well so i wanted to be unrealistic and try to create a sort of tasting menu lol. Luckily the chef owner answered my questions and didn't look stunned when I ordered so much food. I also ordered Tom yum soup along with the house soup that comes with the meal lol. I wanted to try it! \n\nThis is when I realized the server was also the chef, saw her working away behind the counter and I liked that when I stood I could see the big wok and all the dirty work being done ;) \n\nThe house soup, simple as could be but pretty damn tasty. Almost clear, but flavorful broth, couple cubed carrots, couple sprigs cilantro and fried wonton wrapper with some seasoning. I wasn't prepared for something so plain looking to have a flavor punch. I liked the cup size, perfect amount and the wonton was still crunchy on the inside. How does that happen? I just wrote a big paragraph on the cup of soup LOL. \n\nNext came my big pot of Tom yum. I told her not too spicy as I like the sour taste a lot. It was up there, but not my favorite style of tom yum. I'm not sure if the way I like it is more Americanized and possible a tamarind paste is used vs. real stock. I like the sour more prominent but this soup still makes my tummy smile. I also noticed fresh mushrooms here like at fresh creations, I think that's also more authentic than canned straw (but I do prefer the straw mushrooms still). \n\nThe drunken noodle came out next, DELICIOUS, contrary to other reviewers, my noodles were perfect, the sweet heat was just right and the chicken was not dry.  I crave that smell and sweet burn of the drunken noodles. \n\nIt was a little awhile but I got the pad Thai and bean thread noodles together. By this time a helper started helping. Who was friendly enough. The pad Thai was different in that it had round noodles instead of flat ones like you typically see. Also a lemon vs. a lime was served with it. The shrimps were huge and cleaned well, and not overdone. I liked the small fried tofu pieces too, similar to Bangkok. I enjoyed the different noodle style too. I don't think it detracted from the overall dish. \n\nBy this time I only had one bite of bean thread noodle. It was good but I was stuffed and couldn't appreciate the flavors anymore haha. \n\nThis was when I asked if the lady cooking was the owner and I got to chat a bit with her. She was born in Thailand and has lived in Reno for 12 years. We shared some fun stories and we discussed the pros and cons of groupon. So we have another, what seems like, it could be authentic Thai cook and restaurant in Reno. I also asked her how to reheat leftovers and so she gave me some tips I haven't tried so I'm hoping that they turn out alright. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a little more out of my way so I would have to really make and effort to come here, but after my experience today, my favorite spot (sawseedee) has some competition. I think people should give it a try. I didn't get any appetizers or larb or curry though so I can't comment on those main dishes of Thai cuisine. Also the portions could probably be considered a little small, but the plates are pretty big too. The prices seemed on point, $9 for chicken, $11 for shrimp, seafood combo was up there at $17 though, but I imagine its good quality judging from the shrimp I had. \n\nAlso, each plate had a slice of orange which I always like after for palate and mouth refreshing after heavy carbs haha\n\nTL;DR My point is, I say try it. I enjoyed the talk with the chef\/owner (important that she didn't seem... desperate,I guess) and my food very much. \n\nI'll probably be bringing my dad to try it out next time he's in town.","date":"2013-07-16 00:33:45","vector":[0.1965307692,0.2629545455,0.1906333333,0.0,0.0]}

Also, I loved their chips, guac, and queso.\n\nI will be back to try the brisket taco based off how much my friends love it.","date":"2018-03-05 00:27:14","vector":[0.3485214286,0.46715,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The pizza wasn't fantastic but it was everything I wanted right then, hot with melty cheese. There was only cheese and pepperoni and my biggest complaint was the price at $3.50 a slice plus tax, but I took 3 and was very satisfied.\n\nThe next day I can't back for lunch. A half panini sandwich with a cup of soup of the day and a side of chips and a bottle of water for $12. The soup was corn chowder and great,  and the panini was melty and delicious.\n\nPlus, they have a very large selection of donuts and ice cream.

I so badly want this place to thrive, but it has been too many not-so-great experiences to stay quiet. I am still going 4 stars because there are so many wonderful people that work there and I love the space, concept, design, etc. Today's bartender had such an attitude. Hardly anyone in the place on a Sunday afternoon and he could not be bothered. $16 for two beers and I would like a warm welcome. Don't act like I am bothering  you. Attitude is important in customer service - going through the motions is not enough. Previous experiences include a forgotten pizza order, cold food and some other issues, but I always overlook it because we have fun with the games. I still recommend this place to everyone that will listen because I LOVE the concept. Just PLEASE get the bartenders to lighten up, get happy...or at least fake it for the customer. Engage, talk up the beers, sell! This is your job - do it well or move on.\nAnd now they are 100% valet. Not a problem...except we had to wait way too long for our car after we finished. I prefer to walk to my car, even if it is five blocks away.  I totally get why they are all valet now, but it did not help the poor service experience. Valet guys were jamming and not their fault they were busy when we walked out. But not a fan of the valet only option now, but I understand why.\nSo I still recommend Bundox, just hope bartenders start having fun - it is supposed to be a fun place and they set the tone.","date":"2018-06-11 01:59:43","vector":[0.1444666667,0.39564,0.0,0.3020833333,0.0]}

From the outside, it's quite unassuming and unnoticeable as the shades block everything from view. If you're looking for it, it's located in a tiny strip mall beside the Whitemud Crossing EPL branch, Pho Anh Vietnamese Cuisine and Yokozuna is right around the corner.\n\nWe decided to check out TVG for dinner on a Saturday evening. The place was surprisingly busy but we made a reservation for 7 people so we were good to go. The place is family run and all of the staff are very sweet, patient and friendly. I think it's a culture thing as it brought me back to my time of traveling in Thailand and encountering so many genuinely friendly people.\n\nThe menu has lots of options to choose from (around 60 choices) but I found their dishes to be much more pricier than other Thai restaurants in town. For example, the curries range from $17 to $20 each so something to be aware of if you're saving dem dollah bills. It's not like they're the only Thai place on the south side either - heck, Thai Orchid is only a couple streets away.\n\n- Thai iced tea ($3.75) - refreshing and light, I don't think you can ever go wrong with ordering a thai iced tea to start your meal off.\n- 2x Peak gai tod (#4) ($12.95) - deep fried Thai style chicken wings with crispy basil, kaffir lime leaves saut\u00e9 in a sweet and sour chili sauce. These had a nice crunchy exterior and came out piping hot. Don't burn your tongue!\n\n- Tom kha factong (#9) ($11.95 large) - Thai coconut pumpkin soup. Creamy coconut soup with kabosha squash, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves. I think this is the first time I've tried pumpkin in a Thai dish. It was interesting to try but I can't say I was the biggest fan.\n- Geang ped supparodt with chicken (#22) ($17.95) - red curry pineapple in coconut cream with pineapple chunks, red and green sweet peppers. We found this curry to be a bit too sweet for our liking.\n- Pad thai with tofu (#41) ($15.95) - stir-fried rice noodle in a tamarind sauce with egg, tofu, bean sprout, scallion, topped with peanut and cilantro. The paid thai was decent but nothing pops into my mind that sets it apart from others in town. It was a good portion though.\n- Pud kee maow with seafood (#45) ($17.95) - stir-fried thick fresh noodles (aka. spicy drunken noodle) with spicy basil sauce, broccoli, red and green pepper, onion and scallion. Again, another big portion and I was actually impressed by the amount of seafood given. Didn't find the dish very spicy though.\n- Plaa (#48) ($19.95) - a whole fish and you choose the accompanying sauce you want to go with it. We opted for the sweet and sour sauce. The fish was tender and had a good amount of onion, red\/yellow peppers and a couple other vegetables scattered over top. A nice change from our typical Thai dishes that we order.\n- Coconut rice (#55) ($6.95 large) - fluffy, delicious coconut rice. A large order was a good enough portion for all of us.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal but we found most of the dishes to be overly sweet for our taste buds. Truthfully, with the higher price point and solid ratings, I was expecting more. It's in no ways bad but it's not on my must go back to eat again list. Thai Valley Grill falls somewhere in the middle of the pack.","date":"2015-08-24 15:09:34","vector":[0.1426717949,0.7351,0.0,0.0986666667,0.0]}

Pricing varies depending on your meat selection in each dish.\n\nI thought the items varied in quality - the pad Thai was one of the oddest versions I've seen and tasted more like a Chinese noodle stir fry than pad Thai... Totally disappointed by this one. Salad rolls and cashew chicken were pretty average. I did like their spinach dish and the Penang curry - both were nicely flavored and the fresh bed of spinach in the former dish was quite unique.\n\nPrice was a bit steep (around $17-18\/dish) for Thai food IMHO.\n\nOverall a-ok.","date":"2015-01-03 22:59:46","vector":[0.2713,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We came for lunch on a weekday to check out the $10.95 lunch combos.  Arriving at 11:30, the restaurant was empty.  There are about 12 tables for 2 or 4 inside.  During our hour meal, there were 2 others who came in for take out.  The restaurant has been open for about a month so hope word of mouth will give it more business.\n\nThe lunch menu offers a selection of 12 combos of curries with chicken or beef and another 5 or so vegetarian combos.  They also have sweet and sour pork with rice, chicken fried rice, and Pad Thai for those who can't handle much heat.  You can get the combos with 2 vegetable spring rolls or a salad.  I ordered the Pad Thai and my friend had a chicken curry dish.  I liked how they put the peanuts in a little dish and I could pour it on my noodles.  The spring rolls were a little mushy inside but ok.\n\nThe service was good and they provide water with a hint of lemon in it.  I was torn if I should give it 3 or 4 stars but I decided to go with 4 based on the whole experience including service and cleanliness.  My friend said she would give it 3 based on her meal.\n\nI hope this restaurant will stick around for a while as the last few haven't lasted more than a year or two.","date":"2014-07-28 17:05:44","vector":[0.1296142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

They weren't.  \n\nI strolled in to MMCo. on a Monday night at nearly 530PM, the prime time for a dinner service.  Only one other person was inside when I arrived with my partner and we placed our orders while we waited for three more of our friends to arrive later on.  \n\nI wasn't much in the mood for a sandwich (and I've never really found a meatball sandwich to be the type of sandwich that I like) so I opted for the meatball \"bowl\".  I got to choose from pork, veggie, beef or chicken meatballs and the sauce to accompany it; marinara, alfredo, mushroom and perhaps one more that escapes memory.  I chose the beef meatballs, thinking this would be the easy specialty with the mushroom sauce, which was a creamed mushroom sauce, not a red sauce.  \n\nIt wasn't but a few minutes when our orders were brought to our table.  John's meatball sandwich looked good enough but my meatball bowl lacked any sort of suggestion that I'd like to eat it.  \n\nFirst of all, it was served in a plastic salad bowl.  A very small, white plastic salad bowl.  The meatballs were so small....\"How small where they?!\"...the meatballs were so small, I could hear an echo inside the bowl!  No seriously, they were so small that the three of them could rest side-by-side at the bottom of the bowl without piling up on top of one another.  Yeah, so picture that small white plastic salad bowl and how small the bottom circle of that bowl is and now picture three meatballs sitting side-by-side.  \n\nLet's talk about the mushroom sauce.  I'd bet my life that this is nothing more than canned cream of mushroom soup that is perhaps doctored up a little bit.  Would it have been better if it was served warm?  Maybe.  But I doubt it.  It arrived at my table in a sort of congealed manner, like creamed soup that is left on your kitchen counter after dinner has been over with for quite some time.  It was visually unappealing and the taste was no better.  \n\nA word of advice...if you're going to charge me nearly $2.50 per meatball, make it a meatball I'll remember!  Two dollars and fifty cents can buy me nearly a full pound of better quality ground beef at the grocery store.  At $7 for three meatballs, allow them to at least make an impression in the puny little bowl you serve them in!  These did not.","date":"2011-03-22 01:45:15","vector":[0.1293333333,0.0,0.0,0.0754333333,0.0]}

She suggested \"The meatball store.\" To which I responded \"There is no meatball store. Read a book.\" She took it upon herself to find the yelp link to this wonderful, magical place, and upon reading my butt subsequently fell off in fantastic shock. This was a dream come true, and was exactly what I wanted. I promptly drop-kicked my computer, told my coworkers that there was an emergency, and vaulted out of the window.\n\nA few moments later I arrived, sweaty and crazed with passion, to this unique establishment. After unshirting myself to seem less wet and putrid, I approached the tall, friendly looking owner. He greeted me with a smile that would shame your grandfather, and asked if I had ever been there before. I must have used words (which didn't seem possible since I was breathing so heavily) to convey that I had not, because he answered \"Well, we sell meatballs.\"\n\nYes, this was the right place. My journey was almost complete. \n\nAfter explaining my list of options, I ordered a traditional pork meatball (4) on a hoagie roll with mushroom sauce, some sort of aged cheese, and broccoli rabbe on top. He made it with lightning speed and handed me my new hot food baby with the grace of a powdered snow leopard carrying its young. I unwrapped my new pride and joy, burned my fingers a little, and took my first bite. \n\nOh.\n\nOh my god.\n\nOh my good sweet dear god. \n\nMy entire mouth began to weep. My tongue found its new god. My tastebuds began to sing a song unheard of by human ears. My cheeks couldn't get closer to the food. My stomach began to murder my diaphragm in an effort to reach the food sooner. All that I knew that was good in the world suddenly plummeted out of my mind to make room for this new and terrifying thing that my body had found. \n\nAfter finishing the first half of my religious experience, I promptly feel asleep at my table. When I awoke, the store was closed and I had a small, hand-stitched blanket around my shoulders that smelled of sweet grandmothers. In front of me was a glass of milk, a cookie, and a small card. I reached out and touched it, feeling the fine fabric of its makers. It had a word printed on it, but it was without ink, only an impression had been left behind. I ran my thumb over it and made out its message. \n\n\"Love\" it said.","date":"2011-07-29 19:29:30","vector":[0.1022818182,0.4939,0.0,-0.1185,0.0]}

I don't need to pretend I'm eating meat, so thank you for not doing that. Tasty bread, warm sandwich, friendly staff.\n\nThings that I would improve on: LABEL YOUR VEGETARIAN FOOD. So maybe I should just assume that veggie = vegetarian, but I also ordered vegetarian fried rice from a restaurant once that had dried shrimp on it. Plus I swear the woman at the counter said the tomato sauce had meat in it. I'd hate to order something and it come out with meat when I wouldn't think it had it. The only reason I was for sure that the veggie balls were veg was from watching Chuck's show. Also, this place was kinda pricey.

I visited here before a concert at the Fillmore and the location is very convenient. Considering the crowd at the Fillmore was easily in the thousands, I was expecting this restaurant (which is in the same building as the venue) to be busy. Instead, there were only 3 tables occupied at any given time, no hostess, 1 waitress and 2-3 kitchen staff. \n\nI'm not sure if this place is in the process of going out of business or what, but I really was baffled by what seems to be marketed as an upscale restaurant being so... not-upscale.\n\nThe food itself was acceptable. I sent mine back to be heated up as it came to the table luke warm. My friend ordered the chicken picatta and it was fine, though I thought the pasta was a little bland.\n\nUpon entrance, the waitress approached us somewhat aggressively and told us that the restaurant didn't have any alcohol and it was BYOB. We weren't planning on drinking, but what an odd designation for a restaurant that is identified as a \"wine bar\". \n\nDecor was literally falling apart. One of the tables had several of the stones from the wall resting on it. The menus are printed with a poor quality color printer on a simple standard letter-sized piece of paper which further ruined the sense of a fine dining experience.\n\nMy friend said that 2 of the 3 stalls in the men's room had no toilet paper and neither the men's nor the ladies' room had towels, instead opting for a small stack of table napkins.\n\nIn the end, we both agreed that while the food was ok, it wasn't worth the price we paid and the overall feeling of the restaurant wasn't the joyful experience we'd been hoping for.","date":"2016-10-24 17:25:42","vector":[0.1702,0.0,0.0,0.0487857143,0.0]}

When someone at the store finally answered they looked up my order and put me on hold for five minutes. \n\nThey then came back and said that it had been changed to a canceled status and claimed I had \"changed my mind\".

We were like college sweethearts who grew apart but denied it for a few awkward, painful months.  My girlfriends and I used to take advantage of Wednesday martini specials for a dressy girls' evening out. The white bean hummus was (and is) spectacular.  The waitresses were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nThe service and clientele changed drastically though and I no longer feel the same level of comfort.\n\nThe music was the first change. I was told by one of the cocktail waitresses they stopped playing rap and other similar genres because they wanted a change in clientele. I gave them the benefit of the doubt by assuming they meant a change to  the older, sleeker set which began filing in soon after. The drink prices went up slightly. The whole fee began to slowly change.\n\nI was still willing to forgive and adapt until one fateful day when the bartender yelled at us over my friend's $10 tab. My friend had put the money on the counter on top of his receipt. It had disappeared. Mysterious and disappointing sure, but we were treated as though we were trying to scam her even though the other three of us had already paid our more expensive tabs. \"You can't just place cash on the bar,\" she said. Really? Because you can at every other bar ever. When the senior bartender approached we assumed it would be to calm her and remind her that customers, especially regulars, should be treated with respect. He did not. By then  it had become a bit of a scene and other customers around us were making the \"Are they serious?\" eye contact with us. By the time a third employee joined and still refused to listen to reason we left.\n\nIt's just one story, but to me it explains the impersonal effects of their attempt to re-market their restaurant.

I'm sorry Alabama Liquors, please forgive me.\n\nAbout an hour before I had guests arriving for a cookout, I had a hankering for brats soaked in a nice dark German beer. The problem: I had no dark German beer, which only made me want it that much more. I knew I didn't have enough time to run to my normal store, so I made a mad dash to Alabama Liquors in hopes they had what I needed. They did.. and more.\n\nWalking in I wondered what was so special about this place. Walking into the \"secure area\" that I assume isn't open at night for customers, I only noticed 5 or 6 refrigerated coolers for beer, some liquor, and just a couple bottles of wine. Most of the 6-packs of beer had bottles missing from them, and I had to hunt for one that was full. I found the German beer I was looking for, fortunately, and headed up to the cash register. Then, I noticed the \"other room\".\n\nThe \"other room\" is kind of hidden, and I wouldn't have seen it if I wasn't paying attention. There was no sign, there were no flashing lights, and there were no employees advertising it. When I walked in, I realized why people like the place so much. The \"other room\" is full of wine. It's priced pretty decent compared to the big stores, and a selection that I could look through for about 45 minutes to select the perfect wine.  The \"other room\" made my take on Alabama Liquors make a complete 180, and I found myself wishing I had more time to browse. \n\nChecking out, the cashier commented on the German beer that I was buying. I mentioned it was to soak brats in, and he suggested mixing it with another (and thereby saving half a bottle of each for me to drink) to make the perfect stew for a brat bath. I'm pleased to say I took his advice, and the brats were deliciously fantastic.\n\nGive this place a try.. and don't forget about the \"other room\"!!","date":"2013-05-24 03:55:02","vector":[0.0844818182,0.16758,0.0,0.0,-0.1027]}

I'll break the review down into the two visits.\n\nFirst visit, midweek dinner around 6pm. There were a couple of other tables occupied. We went on a night when there wasn't anyone performing. Ellie was our waitress and was the epitome of a cool hippie all grown up. I really liked her. I love the funky light fixtures of different shapes and colours hanging all over the ceiling, and I love the cool art everywhere, even in the bathroom.\n\nBut onto the most important thing, the food. I ordered the turkey curry ($17) and Dave had the pad Thai ($16). Mine was good, but lacked any spice or real kick. Served with rice and roti, the whole plate was mostly bland with the exception of the mango chutney that came with it. I tried a bit of pad Thai and it wasn't really my style, but I've never really liked any pad Thai I've tried, so that's more my issue. \n\nSecond visit, again midweek. No other diners in the restaurant from start to finish. A different, younger waitress. She was ok, but no Ellie. I find it odd when I say thanks to a server (filling up water, etc.) and they say 'no worries' 'no problem' 'not a worry'. I wasn't worried, just saying thanks. You're welcome will do. This time we both ate the bison burger ($15). Mine with salad, his with roasted potatoes. I have to say I was impressed with the size of the salad - it took up half of the plate. The dressing was a simple vinaigrette, but was also sort of bland. I liked the burger at first, but as I was getting through it I liked it a little less. Again it was good and it was probably just a preference thing for me, but there wasn't much on it condiment-wise, so by the end all I could taste was pure meat.  \n\nI really like the atmosphere at Blue Chair and I think it would be a great place to visit when they have live music, but I felt really disappointed in the food. Everything on the menu sounded great and everything I tasted was just average. I know they're trying really hard, but I think they could kick it up a notch in the kitchen. The ideas are there but the delivery is sub-par. Aside from that, I would probably go back to try brunch or if someone invited me out.","date":"2012-11-07 19:30:41","vector":[0.0285615385,0.3182,0.0,0.2656363636,0.0]}

We had a party of eight for a celebration and loved that the place wasn't crowded but wondered why. \n\nWe'd seen the patio on the way into the Lodge area and thought how cool that space was. \n\nProceed to dinner...the meat and cheese plate was plain at best. They could add some candied nuts, honeys to provide some more flavor combos and step up the quality on cheese.  Then we shared the smoked salmon dip. A table of 8 people barely finished a fourth of the dish. It was so salty, the first bite nearly created a lip pucker. The salads my friends ordered looked so very boring. Iceberg lettuce (a no.no in my book) and some basic bacon bits and maybe an egg?  The wings looked dry enough to cause me to not ask my friend for one....and I always rob food from my friends. Last but not least. .the ahi wasn't a high quality piece of fish and again with the salt!!!!  Way overdone in the ginger soy sauce for the tuna.  \n\nAgain, the service was excellent and they had a good selection of cocktails. My friends and I did spend some time on the patio before and after the meal and it turns out.... that's where it was crowded in a Friday night.  Great lively atmosphere. So, my end takeaway is the Lodge is probably an amazing place to hangout, have some beers and kick back. The food won't be the draw to get me back there. Pilsners on the patio will though.","date":"2018-05-06 02:08:34","vector":[0.0292875,0.4939,0.5859,0.2038571429,0.0]}

Oh man, this dish was really really great! My favourite version of a calamari-esque dish in YEG for sure! It came with a delicious dipping sauce     The price is a bit steep at $18 for the portion sauce but the quality is definitely there. The garden salad we had with the additional chicken for $7 was just okay. The salad itself was made with fresh pieces of mixed greens tomatoes and cucumbers. The dressing was too oily for our taste and the pieces of greens were overly large. The added chicken though was grilled with salt and pepper and cooked well. \n\nTo drink we both had a glass of their house made sangria made with grappa. It was really good! No additional fruit pieces though which is what I always look forward to!\n\nService was okay at first but by the end of our visit, my husband was getting \"the eye\" from our server every time he walked by which my husband felt was his sign of getting us to leave since they had a small lineup at the door of diners waiting for a table.

We were quickly seated and greeted by our waitress, who was extremely on the ball. She got everyone drinks and beers without any delays or assistance from other servers. The beer list is quite impressive. The decor inside is very cool for a sports bar. As for meals I ordered a buffalo chicken cheesesteak, which was disappointing in that there was practically nothing on it - I wouldn't order it again or recommend it. My wife ordered a crab cake sandwich, which was much better. In fact all the other sandwiches around me that other people ordered looked far better than mine.  Next time I would probably try the lobster roll. We also ordered the seasoned crab fries, which were good.  While all our meals came out at very different times, I can't really hold that against them when we're a party of 24.  For the kids we just ordered bar pies and chicken fingers and had them all share.  So my verdict is that I wouldn't make special trip to drive a great length to try this place, but it's decent and fun if you're in that area. Really should be 3.5 stars but I gave the edge to them.","date":"2018-03-25 12:50:35","vector":[0.09789,0.05464,0.0,0.4204333333,0.0]}

I get mine with provolone (just not a wiz kinda girl), wit onions, and then add extras like mushrooms, and hot peppers.  I like the ability to add hot peppers and mushrooms to the steak while it's cooking, but they also have a good \"condiments bar,\" which allows you to add extra hot peppers, sweet peppers, thinly sliced pickles, ketchup, and relishes to your sandwich on your own (if you want).

My party opted for the seafood boil and it was good, solid food with hints of being really good.  The portions come in half pound increments so you can definitely order the amount of food your hunger craves.  I got clams and shrimp and the seasoning was tasty.  Traditional crab boil comes with corn on the cob and potatoes and this did too. Would have liked a bit more of the sides than what was provided.  It was not inexpensive but I do feel I got value for the cost.","date":"2018-09-26 23:48:34","vector":[0.169175,0.0,0.34,0.0,0.0]}

Cool vibe, proximity to our home, live music. Where they drop the ball however, is with the food and the service. We've tried eating there a few times, each time ordering something different. The burgers are described as \"seasoned, smashed and seared to perfection.\"  The Stillhouse burgers are made from stamped-out, frozen grocery store patties and lack any seasoning at all. I really didn't want this to be true, but I've had four burgers there between April and December and it's been the same. At $11 a burger, I can't see the benefit to using these patties. If anyone reading this has ever cooked those frozen patties, you can attest to the odd flavor, fat content causing them to buckle when cooked, and that they are not juicy whatsoever. The sidewinder fries, fried pickles and wings are great. The fries should be available as an appetizer. As for the service, our server left us to ask for plates for our fried pickle appetizer and also left us waiting.....and waiting for our check while she was eating in the doorway of the kitchen in full view of the diners. We also were there for the live music that was listed on their Facebook page as starting at 7. Got there at 6:45. Band showed up shortly after 7 to set up. We left at 7:45 and the band hadn't played a note. So we were let down there, too. Had the music been on time, they may have kept us there for a few more beers, meaning more money for Stillhouse. In a nutshell, Stillhouse is great for beer, wings, pickles and the game. Come on, guys. Use fresh ground beef.","date":"2016-12-20 14:46:03","vector":[0.0784,0.0,0.0,0.1591,0.0]}

Look at my photo--A HUGE rolled tortilla, full of chicken, carne asada, and more, topped with two eggs and guacamole, and slathered in a delicious, thick red enchilada sauce. My mother had chicken fajitas.\n\nBoth meals were vibrant and delicious. The \"Fat\" dish was huge, definitely lived up to its name and longer than a foot.

The pizza was pretty good, with a nice crunchy crust, which is usually what I prefer. I really liked the potatoes and egg on top as well. The potatoes seemed to be tossed in some sort of aioli which gave it that great fatty taste. They did have some confusion with the bill and the Axxess deal but it ultimately worked out in the end, and they were very nice about it.

With the weather getting nicer and the open picnic tables at Bainbridge Green, Gigi's seemed well worth the trip to Queen Village. My partner and I called in our order, a Pepperoni and a Cacio e Pepe, 45 minutes in advance, and we made our trip down. But by the time we arrived, we found ourselves hit with another 20 minutes of an additional wait -- regrettable, but understandable amid the crisis.\n\nOn to the food, the pepperoni itself had a robust flavor but is tiny, and the red sauce was surprisingly fresh. Meanwhile, the Cacio e Pepe pie had a surprisingly strong taste of black pepper; moreover, the initially pleasant richness of oil became somewhat one-dimensional by the end.\n\nThe crust of both pizzas was thin and well-cooked, but not good enough to justify how much of it was left un-sauced around the circumference -- I found myself wishing for more marinara on the side. Also, even with the perfect spring weather at the time of our visit, the pies became lukewarm by the last few slices. But, by far, my biggest gripe is that Gigi's pies here are on the expensive side, working out to $20 per pizza after tax and tip. For that price, might as well get opt for a larger and tastier pie elsewhere in the city.","date":"2020-07-05 02:40:51","vector":[0.2298333333,0.0,0.2732,0.2202,0.2023]}

We started out with Spring Rolls (my fave) and Won Ton soup. The soup was SO GOOD! A little heavy on the pepper, but I loved the unique taste! The wontons were stuffed with pork and shrimp and the broth was the most flavorful I've ever had in wonton soup. I can't forget to mention that the soup is served in a bowl as big as your head!\n\nThey had the the usual dishes...we had Chicken Lo Mein, Chicken with Veggies and Rice Noodles and Curry Chicken...but they were unlike anything I've ever had before. I could not get enough of the sauce on the Lo Mein and Rice Noodles. The Curry Chicken was WAY too spicy for me, but my boyfriend loved it.

I contacted a number of caterers after we decided to get married at a vineyard in Los Olivos. The response I received from Philippe stood out right away. Phi not only paid attention to my budget but also to my special requests regarding different types of food we wanted to incorporate in our menu. None of the other caterers in the area seemed to pay attention to my requests and didn't include costs in their bids that I knew we'd incur. \n\nWe scheduled a tasting with Catering Connection and it was fantastic. My fiance (now husband!) is an accomplished cook, and he was blown away as well. We hired them on the spot to provide pre-ceremony drinks, happy hour apps (passed and plated) and bar service, and reception buffet catering and bar service.\n\nCommunication over the next 10 months was easy, consistent, and fast. Phi addressed all of my questions and concerns with endless patience and solutions. He already had a strong relationship with our rentals vendor and worked very well with our coordinator - a bride's dream!\n\nIf I could give them 10 stars I would. The staff was incredible the day of the wedding. Every single staff person we and our guests encountered was friendly, warm, and welcoming. They provided anything we asked for - special plates of food were waiting for us at the reception and a server had a plate of appetizers for us at happy hour so we could sneak a few bites in between the ceremony and reception. Servers quickly provided plates of food for my parents who were visiting with guests when their table was called up to the buffet. \n\nOur guests raved about the food and are still talking about it. The pricing stayed very close to the initial proposal and we didn't have any nasty surprises pop up later. I have worked countless events with a number of different catering companies for work, and I've never seen the quality of food and service we received with Catering Connection before. I highly recommend hiring them for your special event.","date":"2014-09-26 00:19:11","vector":[0.2782285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

They just started a delivery service for lunchtime and deliver meals to your office.\nThere is no minimum purchase, delivery and tax are included in their price.  And the food is UNBELEIVABLE.  It is so good.  Make sure to ask for extra dressing with the salads since they don't always give enough dressing for their generous-sized salads.\n\nI just send them an email and they deliver it to the front of my office or even bring it to my desk if the receptionist is at lunch (they know where my desk is now since I order almost every day).  You can pay with cash, check or paypal (I love the paypal option).\n\nFor example, today I got caught on the phone at 12:15 and couldn't get off the phone call until almost 4pm.  I emailed my lunch order around 1pm and had my sandwich ready to eat on my desk by 1:20pm.  Too bad the call lasted so long.  The sandwich was still delicious.  The entree's can be pricey sometimes, but remember that delivery is included and they don't try to rip you off by marking up all the sides and extras ($1 sodas, bread roll & butter $0.75, chips $0.75 etc).  Their napkins also are kind of crappy but who cares when the food is so good!  The quiche is ok, better than some places but nothing like Fresco's quiche.\n\nFavorites: Southwestern Tri-tip sandwich and BBQ chicken salad - never miss their Chili when its on the weekly special!","date":"2009-08-11 01:17:19","vector":[0.2654083333,0.0,0.13355,0.1204,0.0]}

I was familiar with this space from the previous sub shop tenant and Kruk's makes better use of the space.\n\nEmployees were terrific to me, answering my questions about the store and a couple specific menu items that were new to me like \"broccoli rabe.\"\n\nMy \"Pepper Cheesesteak\" featuring sweet peppers and wiz (I also added tomato at no upcharge) was made fast. Both the meat and bread definitely had the flavor and texture of an authentic philly steak sandwich. \n\nNext time, I will ask to go slightly heavier on the wiz because I want to taste more of that signature ingredient.\n\nBecause it was Kruk's \"Opening Day,\" an appropriate term for a place featuring the name of a longtime major baseball player, all sandwiches were just $5.\n\nEven though Kruk's is brand new to Tampa, the first store opened two years ago and there are now six locations from here to Naples.\n\nI'm told John Kruk should be making an personal appearance at an official grand opening here in the near future.\n\nNot only will he talk about the restaurant, but you will want to hear his story about facing Randy Johnson in the All-Star Game at Camden Yards. It was one of the funniest All-Star Game moments in baseball history and helped make Kruk one of the more likable guys in the game.","date":"2018-08-30 02:34:42","vector":[0.2174375,0.4767,0.0,0.2073666667,0.2202]}

Instead, I ordered the Chicken Cutlet Parm, because I have a weakness for chicken Parmesan. While it arrived sans marinara (oops!), the sauce that came on the side (thanks, embarrassed kitchen dude) was easily added and tasty. Chicken was obviously just prepared, juicy and with crispy breading. It was also cut into strips, which always makes for easier eating in a sandwich.\n\nClean restaurant, nice open kitchen layout, and I was checked on by someone I assume was management. Ordering instructions next to the menu were cute, and they do offer wiz, provolone and American cheese options. Bread was good - if it's not Amoroso, it's close.\n\nSo why only three stars?\n\nFirst, I had to wait almost four minutes for the cashier to deal with something on her tablet. Two of those minutes were spent waiting to be noticed. Not a great first impression. \n\nSecond, whatever combo I ended up buying (I ordered the sandwich, fries and water) included a bottled water and wasn't actually on the menu. It would be nice to see this in print so an educated decision can happen.\n\nLast: price. Yeah, I know there's not a lot of room in that $ range, but they're right next to Five Guys, so $12 seems a bit steep for the portion size in both sandwich and fries. \n\nI'll stop in again for the Philly steak and reevaluate.","date":"2018-09-13 19:00:43","vector":[0.1104714286,0.0,0.0,0.03165,0.0]}

We were craving a good gyro since our honeymoon in Greece in October 2018. We were promptly greeted and seated at our table. We ordered a mint tea and honey tea. Both were amazing. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the feta sauce fries. For dinner, my wife got the Gyro (which comes with pork) and I got Spyro, which has sliced roasted lamb. One bite into the Gyro put my wife right back in Greece. The Gyro matched up to many of the gyros we had in Greece. The Spyro was a unique and untraditional twist on the Gyro, and it was delicious. The lamb was tender and moist and had a delicious lemon flavor. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the Christmas cookies and the dough balls in syrup. We were blown away by the desserts. The pricing was reasonable. The service was great. The atmosphere was wonderful. I highly recommend this place for a date or small group. They apparently now open for lunch and offer takeout.

I know there are a few more authentic locations (that I invite all to support and try out) but I for one welcome this addition to the center city food scene.\n\nFor a group of 3, we ordered 2 appetizers and 3 bbq entrees. This along with drinks for everyone was probably slightly more food than we needed but I would say that the biggest negative of this place is the expensive price and the quantity. 5 strips of kalbi short rib will run you about 40-50$; however I do understand things will be more expensive in center city. \n\nThe scallion pancake was doughy and unlike the fried crispy scallion pancakes we expected but we enjoyed them. We also shared the fried Mandu which was OK but nothing to get super excited about. \n\nIn terms of bbq, you get one charcoal grill and a choice of meats to cook it on. We ordered the bo ssam (pork belly), spicy pork shoulder, and the kalbi short rib. Of these choices, the bo ssam comes to you already cooked and the other two you cook on the grill. \n\nWith the meets you get an assortment of small plates (banchan). This includes traditional kimchi, scallions, carrots, lotus root, potato salad, corn, white kimchi, rice, lettuce. These are unlimited so be sure to ask for refills if desired. My favorites were traditional kimchi, carrots, and potato salad. \n\nOut of entrees, bo ssam is excellent; crispy skin with very fatty and tender pork belly. Goes great with lettuce wrap and some banchan. The kalbi was very tender with a sweet marinade but the only negative I would say about it is that it was a bit fattier than i would've liked for the price. Spicy pork shoulder has a nice taste and is much cheaper than the other two options we ordered. \n\nOverall, the ambience is fun, the charcoal grills are a nice touch and the food was enjoyable for people who miss going to kBBQ. Our whole meal for 3 people came to about 80-90$ a person and save to say we were stuffed by the end.","date":"2020-08-20 16:47:15","vector":[0.182496875,0.0,0.4215,0.0,-0.0510333333]}

The Mac n cheese is creamy, thick, rich and delicious. \n\nThe first time I got the BBQ bowl with chicken, cornbread crumble and BBQ sauce. It was superb. The BBQ sauce was just smokey enough and had the exact right amount squirted on to be flavorful but not overwhelming. The cornbread was somehow dry and moist at the same time. It had that distinctive somewhat sweet, grainy texture that I love about cornbread. Yum yum! \n\nToday, I ordered the Basil chicken pesto Mac. It was delicious. The (potato chips?)crumbled on it gave it random notes of saltiness. I wish it had a bit more chicken but I would probably say that no matter how much chicken was on it... I'm a meat lover. I also would like a bit more garlic in the pesto but that's a personal preference. \n\nFor a full five stars, if they layered the toppings half way down and then put more Mac and then more toppings, that would be perfect. I'm lazy and don't feel like mixing up my Mac to get an equal amount of flavor in each bite! \n\nEach time, I ordered the medium (available in medium or large) and it was massive. No one should eat that much Mac n cheese in one sitting but I couldn't resist.","date":"2014-05-14 17:20:01","vector":[0.2784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

One meat vendor, a honey vendor and a few other food related booths.  There are several bakeries and some really good ready to eat food (guacamole!).  Several of the neighborhood groups have booths, so it's a good way to find out what's happening in the neighborhood.  But nearly half of the booths are crap.

Some of the others are very small and not much to offer. (Broad Ripple was good.)\n\nThe caveats are that it's only once-a-month in the summer and they don't give much info on social media unless you can figure out to Google the Irvington Garden club. I know they get plenty of business so probably don't think it's necessary but it would be really helpful for anyone who is not a \"local,\" or lived here their entire life.\n\nYeah parking is kind of hard, but it's not nearly as bad as folks describe. You have to park and walk but often I arrive around 1 \u00e0nd folks are already leaving. It's never taken me more than 2-3 minutes to reach the park if I had to park in the neighborhood.\n\nIt's a great place to take a dog, because there are a lot there. My dog always has a good time.\n\nI do think they could use more food vendors. Often the lines are very long and some of the vendors are very slow and also only take cash. There used to be a very good guacamole and chips vendor that would sell out in the first couple hours and leave. There is usually 1 bbq, 1 Mexicans food, 1 ice cream, 1 bakery, 1popcorn. The market is really well attended and could easily have more food vendors with no loss to the current.\n\nThere are some picnic benches and tables but very few and limited shade. If you are gonna stay awhile or can't stand\/walk the entire time you are gonna need to bring a chair.

If you consider yourself a regular in the farmer's market circles, you know this is a nice change to see, as you usually are bumping someone's shoulder or playing frogger so you don't step on a dog's paw. If I were you, I would replace a woven tote bag with a shopping cart, because at the Irvington Farmer's Market, you are going need something on wheels to transport your purchases. The market has a slew of great locally-crafted stuff. Don't frown at the lack produce, because it's been replaced with baked goods, kettle corn, Bee Roasters coffee, yard ornaments, salsa, potential pups, bouquets of flowers, jewelry, and Wildflower Ridge honey. You'll be happy to see both the familiar faces of other markets as well as new faces unique to the Irvington Farmer's Market.\n\nOn my visit I walked away with cold brew and beans from Bee Roasters, lemon-mint-ginger cookies from Fluff Bakery, sweet corn tamales from 3 in 1, honey peanut butter from Wildflower Ridge, and eclectic floral yard ornaments made from antique plates. I would have snagged a popsicle from Nicey Treat, but sadly I had my hands at max capacity. (See why you need a shopping cart?)

This place has a nice atmosphere inside with music playing and nice decor consisting of stainless steel kegs displayed above the tap wall. Employees were all very friendly and welcoming. They asked if it was our first time and explained the pizza options (pre-selected toppings based on the menu selection or build-your-own with unlimited toppings). Afterwards, our pizzas went into the 500 degree oven for a short period to cook. In the meantime we paid and started a tab for the beer tap wall.  You get a wristband to scan above the beer tap of the beer you would like before pouring your beer and you return it upon closing your tab. You pay by the ounce, prices vary depending on the beer selected. Very nice selection of craft beers available. There are a couple of glass rinsers located on opposite ends of the drain grates below the taps. Great concept as you can pour as little or as much beer per pour as you would like. It is nice to be able to pour small amounts and be able to sample different beers. I had a team member, who I believed to be a manager, come up and ask what I thought about the tap wall after I poured a beer. He informed me that the beers constantly rotate out, meaning when one keg is emptied, an entirely new beer is added in its place. This means there are always new beers every time you go. One tip I would suggest, which was told to us after visiting a place similar to this in Asheville, NC, is to place the wristband that you are provided around your pint glass and all you do is hold your glass up to scan before you pour your beer. Seems to work out better than holding your wrist up each time. Great pizza + great beer = WIN WIN!","date":"2017-06-19 02:29:58","vector":[0.1698466667,0.0,0.03895,0.1933,0.0]}

We've been there a bunch of times for dinner buffet and we enjoy it so much more than ordering from a menu. Their buffet has a huge variety of entrees and sides, definitely more than most Indian buffets have for lunch.\n\nWe went tonight and the food was exceptional. I don't know if they have a new chef or something, but everything was just fantastic. \n\nSo why four stars instead of five? The staff there has one habit that drives me crazy - they wipe off clean silverware with a towel in the corner and throw it into a silverware bin. It's so loud that I don't know how anyone can bear to have a conversation while they do that. Also, when they clear dishes from a table, they practically toss them into a buspan, making a huge racket. \n\nI know this sounds like a minor gripe, but it happens every time we go and it's a huge annoyance.

It was lightly battered, tender (nothing worse than an overly chewy piece of octopus), nicely spiced and served with a delicious simple marinara sauce that I would have happily slurped up if no one was watching.  I just wish that they served lunch with a piece of bread - mmmm, nothing like sopping up good marinara sauce with good Italian bread.\n\nFor the main dish, I had a hankering for fettucine alfredo ($14).  For just $5 more, I had my choice of shrimp, chicken or salmon to add to the dish.  I originally wanted shrimp, but it wasn't available that day so I went with the salmon  The dish arrived steaming hot with thick tendrils of freshly shaved parmesan cheese.  I was happily surprised by how much salmon was added for just a few dollars.  It was a very, very generous serving.\n\nI survived the oncoming food coma long enough to pay my bill ($28 total plus tip).

Given the number of one and two star reviews mixed in with the five, I'd say the biggest problem is consistency. I don't doubt that others have had good meals and service, but it seems it's a crap-shoot. You might have a good experience, but then there's a good chance you might have a really bad one too. At $80-125 for two, is that really a roll of the dice you're comfortable with? Consistency is really important.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I went there last night (Monday) and was fairly disappointed. First, they had two brands of wine, neither of which are very high-end. I'd expect this from a Mexican restaurant or some low-end establishment, but from a supposed fine Italian restaurant? No draft beers either, but that's not nearly as bad. \n\nWe had the bruschetta to start. It was nice and fresh but definitely could have used more garlic. I ordered the meat lasagna while my girlfriend ordered the mushroom ravioli in a creamy red sauce.\n\nThe meat lasagna wasn't very good. The meat tasted a little off and the sauce was very sour; very poorly balance. I ate very little of it; instead we essentially shared the ravioli. \n\nThen mushroom ravioli was the best thing we ate all night. A rich red sauce with cream and lots of mushrooms and garlic along with mushroom stuffed raviolis I would eat this again, but since it was the only thing worth eating, I don't think I will.\n\nFinally, the service was sub-par. It wasn't horrible, but we had to ask for several things twice despite being one of only two tables. The bread, for example, didn't come out until I was done with my lasagna and my GF was three bites from finishing her ravioli. \"Oh, this comes with dinner!\" was what the waiter said as he placed it on the table. \n\nOver all, the quality is commensurate with a place half the price. If I'm going to pay $80 for dinner (and only that cheap because we didn't order a bottle of middling wine), I can think of a number of places I'd rather go.","date":"2013-08-06 23:13:48","vector":[0.08221875,0.0,0.2553,-0.0257333333,0.0]}

So, it was only natural that we have a French Connection outing here.\n\nThe interior is really class with white walls and a nice bar area. As we were a group of ~30, we had two (very confused) servers helping us out. One of them was hella incompetent and made a ton of mistakes on our bills. My end of the table had to send ours back because items were added\/omitted from our final checks. This is why I'm knocking off one star.\n\nAnyway, on to the food. I ordered a kir royal, which is champagne with raspberry syrup and often found in bars in France. Let me be clear: French syrups and American syrups are very different. This isn't like Hershey's or something. They're more like Sage's Simple Syrups if you're a local familiar with them. Mine had a wee raspberry in it. Cute.\n\nFor my dinner, I ordered the Gallette au magret du canard (duck filet crepe) with ratatouille and greens, and it was absolutely phenomenal, the duck was tender, and it really did remind me of something from France.\n\nOf course, we all had to indulge in a nice dessert while there. I originally wanted their Cafe Gourmand, which is their dessert sampler with your choice of tea, coffee, or hot chocolate, which was the only dessert they didn't have that evening. I decided to go for the Tarte Bourdaloue, which is a pear tart, and of course it was great as well.\n\nI will most certainly be coming back, but probably not with a huge group like this last time.

During my meal my child decided to take the old #2 and needed my direct attention. I get up and go to the men's room and realize that there is no changing table. The female workers were amazing as they allowed me to go into the women's restroom to change my son. I contacted corporate and received an email from Jack Hickton the Managing Partner telling me that my request was under consideration and was a reasonable suggestion. Well 5 months later I guess the male caregiver has another place not to visit because the management cant spend approximately $100 - $200  to install a changing table.  I know to a lot of people this might not be a big deal but when you have to go outside of a business to change your child in the back of your car because a changing table in the mens restroom is a hassle for management install you will understand my plight.","date":"2016-04-15 19:30:41","vector":[0.0,0.1953,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

However today it was just more convenient to eat at the 23nd Ave location near Century Park.  I was very surprised to find that I enjoyed my meal and it was healthy too. I had the breakfast burrito which came with a huge helping of fruit (see the photo). The burrito was very filling as it was made with 3 eggs. I wish they offered a two egg burrito as I was just stuffed after eating. It came with lots of fruit to erase any guilt I felt at eating so much as well as finishing off all the sour cream. My guest had a waffle which came with 3 kinds of meat. She also found it too big but certainly enjoyed it. Service was very friendly and prompt. The prices seemed high for breakfast so they could make slightly smaller dishes for a lower price but some people might like that much food. In theory you can't eat too much fruit so I'm okay with my order. Coffee was fine, about what you would expect from a chain.  There were lots of other good things in the menu so I can actually recommend this place to anyone with a big appetite.  I think in another review someone said this is like Cora's used to be before they changed their menu and I would agree with that.

The front desk girl gave me a bag with two water bottles and a coupon for a free ice cream.  (number of guests checked in: two).  Next morning decided to try the hot, warm breakfast.

I asked if he would cook them for me .. he wasn't to happy!\nSecond morning breakfast, I tried the already prepared waffles and pancakes.  Both wee so hard that I showed them to the second cook who quickly took them away.\nThe manager (who was standing nearby) asked the cook to prepare an order of pancakes for me.  He replied that he didn't have the \"batter\" however, several minutes later was able to make them. ???\nJust a side note ... we were able to open both the sleeper sofa and ironing board but couldn't not close them.

Mela is phenomenal. We went with our old standby, butter chicken, just to get our toes wet and test the waters a bit. Along with the entree, we also got garlic naan bread, vegetable samosas, and stuffed bread pakora. I've never had or heard of stuffed bread pakora before, and let me tell you, I am SO happy I tried it. It's two pieces of bread stuffed with kinda the same mixture as the samosas and breaded with a chick pea batter then fried. Wowie!  It's a carb lover's dream!!  The naan bread was top notch. It was soft and fluffy, not tough, chewy, or burned like has been my experience lately with another Indian restaurant. The samosa wrapper was light and crispy, and the filling was on point, not too spicy but definitely not bland. The other Indian restaurants around here seem to have ones from the frozen section at Costco. Lastly, the butter chicken:  oh my gosh!  Delicious!  The chicken was tender and not dry, the sauce was fantastic, and the basmati rice was cooked to perfection. We got our food for takeout, and the appetizers came in this cute little paper box instead of styrofoam, which I appreciate because I don't like hot bread items in styrofoam. They end up getting all soggy, not to mention styrofoam is terrible for the environment and is filled with chemicals that could possibly leech into the food. Warning:  If you call to place an order, they might not answer right away. I think there was only one person working the front of the house and taking phone orders. I called three times and almost gave up. Luckily, I called back and got someone to answer on the fourth try. Not a big deal, just wanted to let others know. Overall, Mela knocks it out of the park and I'm so happy to have a new Indian restaurant option on the south side!!!","date":"2021-04-12 13:01:47","vector":[0.16665,0.0,0.0,0.1906333333,0.0]}

We were a group of 10 and supposed to have reservations at 6:30pm. Man oh man, what can I say about Enzo's - food was delicious but they need to fix their act pronto on the service aspect of their business. Let me explain. \n\nFirst, even though we had reservations, we didn't get our table for over 40 minutes. Not a big deal (it happens - can you say lingerers) but it gets worse. This was for a family dinner so when you reserve, you expect to have a table that sits everyone together. Right? That's just common sense (or so I thought). Apparently not. It was bizarre - the owner refused to shuffle the two tables around so that we could sit together even though it literally would take two seconds AND wasn't going to bother anyone (we already had one whole corner of the restaurant where the tables were). He was adamant about not moving them but my sister  was able to convince him otherwise. Boom, problem solved. Everyone fit and we were able to sit\/dine together. \n\nAnother odd thing was the waitresses. First time it's ever happened but we had two servers taking our orders. Essentially, they split our table in half. Maybe it's because they were young? I dunno but I found that a little strange. They were both super nice and understanding so no beef with them.  My other complaint (pretty major - Ramsay would be experiencing multiple ulcers if he heard this happening at his resto) was that the dishes came out at THREE different times. I think five of us were served the first time our entrees, then three of us and then the last two. This is definitely a no-no. When my dad was being served his entree, my brother in law's mom was already done her meal! I will stop complaining though because this is clearly already too long and I haven't even talked about the food.\n\nJust thought you should know and maybe this is not the best place to go if you have more than 4 people (at least not until they have been around for a couple of months and are able to fix these issues).\n\nAnyways, for the food, everyone found the food tasty and cooked very well. I think this is what everyone ordered:\n\n- You get fresh bread with olive oil\/balsamic vinaigrette to start. Soft and tasty.\n- Some kind of red wine ($36 for the bottle)\n- Bocconcini pomodoro ($9) - tomatoes with basil in EVOO.\n- Gamberoni ($22) - jumbo tiger prawns and my sister go the soup (minestrone). Lots of veggies and she said she liked it.\n- 2x Vongole ($15) - baby clams in a zesty red sauce for me. Pasta was cooked perfectly. You choose long (linguini) or short (penne) pasta.\n- 4x pescatore ($26) - linguini seafood pasta. Good portion and lots of crab, scallops, shrimp and mussels. I had a taste of my mom's and once again, pasta was cooked perfectly!\n- 2x Pollo parmigiana ($22) - they were able to accommodate my grandma's dish and give her the chicken parmigiana without tomato sauce and the pasta. Instead, she got a fresh salad and vegetables to go with her chicken. \n- 2x bolognese ($15) - meat sauce pasta. The amount of pasta you get is huge!\n- 3x tiramasu ($7) - comes in one of those fancy dessert wine glasses. Looked yummy but I didn't get to try it.\n\nSo to sum up, everyone was happy about the food. So hope they can fix up those issues above and then I can recommend it to my friends. 3.5 stars for now until they improves their service.","date":"2013-06-24 04:46:28","vector":[0.1136083333,0.1833,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

It's my go-to place for lunch with a drive thru. It's about 5 minutes down Manchester from my office...and I drive by a few other drive thrus and a bunch of other go-inside places to get there. \n\nI think the menu is great. They have wraps, rice bowls, salads and a few pasta bowls. I also really like that they revamped the menu a few years ago and now the entrees don't come with a specific protein - you can choose chicken (white or dark), salmon, beef, or tofu...maybe more options...but I almost always get chicken so I'm not sure. \n\nYou also get to pick between quinoa, white or brown rice for everything. I wouldn't do quinoa in the wraps, it tends to get messy. Stick with the brown rice. \n\nMy favorite item is not on the drive thru menu but every time I've asked they've had it. I saw it on a sign as a new salad when I was inside the Clayton location this summer. It's the multi-grain salad. It's got quinoa, brown rice, chickpeas, avocado, greens, some other stuff I can't remember and a great dressing. I usually get it without protein, but have added salmon on top when I'm really hungry. \n\nI also LOVE the pesto wrap with brown rice and dark meat chicken, but this is one of the highest calorie items on the menu according to the website...so I try not to get it very often. \n\nOther favorites are the BBQ wrap with chicken and the zesty bean soup bowl with chicken. \n\nThe wraps and salads also come with salt covered tortilla chips. If I had a complaint, it would be that sometimes they aren't salty enough, sometimes they are perfect. \n\nAnd there is a salsa bar inside which includes hummus. I'm assuming you could ask for it to go through the drive thru too but I've never tried. \n\nOh, and for a drive through, they are super fast but give you fresh food. \n\nAnd while it technically is a chain as they have a bunch of locations, it's a local chain. \n\nI like that.","date":"2011-12-16 01:31:47","vector":[0.0624275862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Here's why.  First, they were out of bacon.  Seriously, how does that happen?  Not that I ordered anything with bacon on it but several members of my group were saddened by that news.  Second, there was pretty slow service.  I did read reviews beforehand and I knew what to expect but still, it's worth mentioning.  Once we had our food no one came to check on us and it wasn't until everyone was finished and we were sitting with empty plates for, mmm, ten minutes that the server actually came back to clear or even just show us she cared.\n\nThird, the other star got taken off because of the sweet potato fries.  Maybe it was because they were talked up in reviews and my all of my classmates but I was kind of disappointed in the end.  By the time they got to me they were mushy and cold.  They also look exactly like a certain kind of sweet potato fry I can buy in the freezer aisle of the grocery store.  That's not to say they weren't tasty, because they were, but there was something seriously lacking in the presentation of a cold and mushy pile of orange fries.\n\nAnyways, I can say that my sandwich was awesome.  I had the Bleu Bliss sandwich with bleu cheese, almonds, honey, cranberries, black pepper, and Granny Smith apples.  It was a hot and pressed panini that hit all the right notes.  I sincerely enjoyed its gooeyness.  Honestly probably one of the best grown up grilled cheeses ever.  Don't be scared if you're not a total bleu cheese kind of person.  It isn't overwhelming at all.  The honey mellows it out and then you get that tartness of the cranberry and sweet crunch of the apple.  Greatness.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try dessert but you can bet I'll be back to jump on that train sometime soon.  The whole case display looked incredible.

When I came back to Edmonton, I immediately googled up the closest place I could go for my new favorite obsession!\n\nTutti Frutti did not live up to my Americanized frozen yogurt expectations, sadly. When I was there, there were only seven flavor options - lots of the machines on the wall weren't running. Granted, it is the middle of the winter and I can understand demand being a little lower, but it still made me a little sad. Some of the yogurt was a little runny and there wasn't a huge variety of options - you either had fruit, or chocolate, nothing else! I tried out the double chocolate (tasted like chocolate!! no disappointments there) and the taro (amazing!!!) but I would have liked a bit more variety.\n\nThe toppings bar was a little messy, and I was disappointed they didn't have actual hot fudge available (just a store-bought squeeze bottle of Smuckers chocolate syrup). I did appreciate that they had the peanut topping off by itself away from the other toppings (my BF is allergic and one stray peanut could be a fro-yo-disaster!)\n\nI was disappointed that the actual space is downstairs - the lighting is super harsh and it's too bad you can't really sit upstairs and enjoy the great Whyte Ave atmosphere. \n\nI know that my Menchie's experience in the United States really set the bar high, but I just feel like Tutti Frutti could have done a little better!! It was a fun experience but I think I'll shop around for a better frozen yogurt experience in Edmonton.","date":"2012-01-10 09:00:52","vector":[-0.0262857143,0.0,0.0,0.3365666667,0.0]}

When I was down in the States, I ate Pinkberry almost every day, and so it was a thrill to see an American-style fro yo spot make its way up north. Unfortunately, the yogurt wasn't that great.\n\nTutti Frutti is just what I've been looking for. 12 flavours of frozen yogurt that change regularly and more toppings than I can count.\n\nHere's the secret to creating a masterpiece at TF: Don't choose toppings like jelly beans or marshmallows. They get hard when they hit the cold ice cream and they're tough to eat. Stick with Oreo crumbs, nuts, sprinkles, etc. You won't be sorry!\n\nI wish this place wasn't underground (no natural light) but it's still a happy space with very happy treats!","date":"2011-09-28 22:35:27","vector":[0.10895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The toast was delicious. Thick nutty bread covered in almond butter, mixed berries, agave and coconut flakes. So why you ask the 4 stars and not 5? Well they are a newly opened business so all the menu items weren't available yet. There was only two cold pressed juice options available out of the 7-8 choices that were listed.

They have some pretty great soups: the only comparable Downtown soup places are Au Bon Pain and Cafe Zuppa for also having a wide range of options.  One of my favorites is the stuffed bell pepper and their tomato soup.  They used to have a great cheesy beer bratwurst soup, but I haven't seen that one in a very long time.  \n\nThen there's the salad aisle.  I have to admit, I've been obsessed with one specific salad here, the penne pasta salad, and so I haven't even tried any of their other salads.  The penne pasta salad mixes up spinach, penne pasta, onions, sunflower seeds, Parmesan cheese, and a salad dressing--it's full of flavor, filling, and yet healthy!\n\nThen there's the sandwich and wrap section.  They have a delicious chicken salad croissant sandwich, some really great paninis, and some fun wraps.  My favorite panini, a mushroom and ham panini is no longer on the menu, but I've liked every other panini I've tried, including the Cuban I bought a few weeks ago.\n\nOne amazing option: their cheesesticks.  They're absolutely amazing.  They're covered with a thick layer of cheese and perfect for dipping into their tomato soup.  I've often come here for nothing more than a cup of soup and two cheesesticks for my lunch.  Get the cheesesticks with a salad as one of their daily lunch specials.\n\nThis place is the perfect lunch-on-the-go place.

The driver said he would come back with my missing order but he failed to deliver it.

I ordered this and paid for it, I should be able to receive it tonight. The business I work at closes at 10:30. I am still here waiting and still nothing. I even called them multiple times but no answer. I have your driver on camera taking MY copy of the receipt and taking MY money from me.

Now that's a little ridiculous for a sandwich.

The avocado shake should have been thicker and cold, not runny and room temperature, but the taste was all right.

Although I didn't order anything to eat, they had a large display of options from cookies, desserts, and pastries, to a menu to order sandwiches, soups, and salads. They also sell snacks, such as trail mix bars, energy bars, protein bars, etc.\n\nThey really do have a large option for every person, no matter what your dietary restrictions or preferences!","date":"2017-02-10 23:59:37","vector":[0.09026,0.4767,0.0,0.36014,0.0]}

My wife and I wanted to check out Nashville Crossroads but the hordes of partygoers packing every single spot veered us away from Broadway. \n\nBroadway on a Sunday night seemed to be a lot more subdued and thankfully we didn't see elbow-to-elbow crowds. Nashville Crossroads turned out being the exact experience we were hoping to come across on our visit to the country music capital of the world where until we came to this venue, we came across bands playing Ricky Martin and Bon Jovi more than country music. The band performing when we came in was great, they took requests, but wouldn't play anything other than country; me wife and I aren't particularly familiar with country music, but this was a totally fun experience for us both. We can listen to a cover band playing classic rock or top 40 hits in any given city, so it was great get a taste of something new. \n\nYou have your basic domestic bottles for $4, some imported stuff in bottles for $5, but get yourself a Yazoo pale ale and enjoy the show, and then follow up with some bourbon (of which there are plenty of selections). \n\nSimple, fun, and somewhere we would definitely go back to when in Nashville.","date":"2015-09-02 17:37:40","vector":[0.4939,0.0,0.0,0.23835,0.0]}

We stayed at the Treme Mansion and was delighted to find this place (and 'Lil Dizzy's) an easy block and a half away... Quite a relief after hoofing miles through the Quarter for days.\n\nIt's got an open-air feeling with the opened-shutter windows, cozy sidewalk seating, and an interesting history if you care to google. Let's just say this cozy corner has been a kept corner for a few different proprietors, and the remnants of such infidelity linger in the 50 year old peeling paint that once advertised the 45 Dixie beers sold by the original Ruth.\n\nThe menu is Turkish inspired, offering the Mediterranean breakfast of cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, egg, and cheese (What?? Americans don't eat that for breakfast!), along with a couple egg dishes, breakfast sandwiches, and paninis. They also have a pastry case brimming with savory boreks, muffins, and sweet treats. They offer a full service coffee bar, complete with cold brew iced coffee, which, alas and alack, they'd already run out of by 9:30 am.\n\nI had the spinach\/cheese\/egg breakfast sandwich, which was wonderfully situated atop a phenomenal hommade bisquit (true menu-board spelling, bless their hearts). The cooked spinach that usually repulses me on a sandwich (I much prefer fresh leaves) didn't taste like the frozen stuff that I hate. I honestly think Fatma cooked fresh spinach... and it was awesome. I also got the veggie borek (wonderful) and the veggie muffin (awesome concept!) to take back to the room for later. They were savory unlike the zucchini bread of my heritage, and I very much enjoyed them for lunch. \n\nHubby had the Turkey panini, which was so good that, as God is my witness, it resurrected the lighthearted disposition that had been crucified by the errant computer system mixup, which brought his meal out a good 15 or 20 minutes after mine. I thought the day was done until I saw the sparkle in the eye behind his aloof facade as he gobbled.\n\nFatma and cashier girl, you're doing a great job 11 days after opening this new location... Sooooo close to a five-star. But here's some tips:\n1. The wait at the counter due to having one cashier who also works as barista is pretty tiresome. Anyone who has somewhere to be will go elsewhere.\n2. A water station would be awesome! Throw a couple cucumber slices in there (I know you have em) and you're instantly two rungs higher-society. Just a suggestion.\n3. Thanks for not charging me for the muffin, but don't do that computer system mixup thing again. It almost killed the mood.\n4. For crying out loud, MAKE MORE COLD BREW! running out at 9:30 on a Monday morning?? That's just really bad market projection.","date":"2017-04-11 03:10:35","vector":[0.2425551724,0.24695,0.0,0.1047,0.0]}

If you've ever spent time where the intense liquors are coming together, then you're aware that it's a pretty painstaking process, full of time and careful aging, and in this case boasting a 100+ year old still that at one point went rogue, apparently, during it's existence (once Prohibition was over, it went legit again). \n\nI'd recommend stepping over to the tasting room next door after the brief tour (it's a pretty boutique space, after all) and letting them mix you up something special.

The onion rings are really tiny and batter fried, and really enhance the flavor of the brisket when eaten together.

All the toppings were a lot more fresh than Papa Johns and some other chains.\nThe spicy red sauce is yummy too. Get that!\n\nPrice. This is a 11 inch diameter pizza meant for one person. That is in between a small and medium size for Papa Johns. The default price w\/o any crust mods is $9. (9.58 with Tampa sales tax)  This is quite economical and could even be 2 meals for kids and some women (Not Lizzo)\n\nCons:\n\nThe only real drawback is that the crust is VERY thin and thus is a bit insubstantial (in terms of satiety) compared to many other restaurants. Im guessing this helps in getting the pizza cooked fast and keeping expenses low. There is a high rise crust mod that costs $2.50 extra.  There are keto and cauliflower crusts that are an extra 2-3 dollars. \n\n\nWhile the toppings are unlimited, they only apply each sparingly. I can understand bc they have to make a profit to stay in business. I would recommend getting as many as you can to get the most value for your money.\n\nOverall: A tasty and budget friendly pizza choice that is better than many chains.","date":"2021-02-09 04:08:27","vector":[0.1591388889,0.0,0.10144,0.0,0.0]}

My favorites are the Belle Meade and Strawberry Fields. They also have amazing homemade salad dressings. You can buy them by the bottle there.\n\n5. The best fruit tea around. I get my money's worth when I dine in. However, you'll need to take out a small loan to buy it by the gallon!\n\nI never leave here hungry. 1\/2 sandwich fill me up.

I was completely grossed out! First impression was that this place isn't the cleanest. We figured we might fare better inside. Big mistake! We stepped out and ordered at the window. We decided to stand, rather than sit at the disgusting tables and chairs. Mind you, this was the middle of a very slow afternoon, so no excuses about busy night! We got our drinks, and the moisture on the outside of the cup was all dirty from the guy's hands. Should have left, but our hunger and the smell got the best of us.

We kept them in an ice chest until we ate them about 5 hours later.

There was only one other customer besides the two of us right at noon. But our order took 40 minutes to prepare. The only explanation is that they had a single to go order with 13 orders. But it is prime noon time and even with that one order there was no excuse for the extreme delay. Also, they didn't tell us about being overwhelmed with a single take out order until after 30 minutes. Had they told us when we ordered we'd simply have gone elsewhere.\n\nI had the lamb kabob. The lamb was flavorless and extremely tough, not much of it The rice pilaf was just white rice, no spices or other ingredients and very bland. It didn't even seem like they added salt to cook the rice. Likewise the lettuce had some salad dressing on it but it was flavorless oil for the most part. And the tzatziki was very watery and again totally lacking in flavor. The tomatoes were OK but they were just sliced tomatoes.\n\nMy wife had the moussaka which was OK but mostly by virtue of the flavor of the beef in it. Her bulgur pilaf had some onions and other items in it but once again it was totally bland and virtually flavorless. All ingredients seemed fresh but the meal had nothing going for it in terms of flavor. I think maybe serving coffee and such is their speciality. Oh, and since you had to pay by credit card in advance of receiving your meal we did our usual 20% tip. Given that we bussed our own table, got our own silverware and napkins and poured our own water the service consisted solely of telling us our meal was going to be late after 30 minutes had already gone by and carrying our plates over to us. I was tempted to ask for a refund of the tip but decided we'd simply move on to something a bit better in the future. Lots of good Middle Eastern restaurants in town but Fatoush isn't one of them based on our experience.","date":"2016-06-01 18:25:43","vector":[0.1402470588,0.0,0.148,0.0,0.0]}

They were really light handed on the sauces so everything was pretty dry and not mixed in well. Toppings are limited and anything good is an extra charge. Somehow ended up paying $1.50 for a tiny scoop of mango. \n\nPretty unsatisfying, but service was good and workers are kind. Maybe I've been spoiled by Poke King just down the street, which is just as pricey for double the food and way more freedom. Don't think I'll be back unless I'm desperate for sushi and can't get off campus.","date":"2018-01-31 01:07:13","vector":[0.055875,0.0,0.0809,0.4939,0.0]}

The list of options are endless. If nothing appeals to you, you can create your own. Bowls range from 8.99-12.99. It is a little pricey especially if you're a broke college student. However, they portions are so big you will definitely get a bang for your buck!  You get a choice of white rice or brown rice. A choice of protein salmon, tuna, chicken, eel etc and choice of vegetables. All the ingredients are super fresh. The presentation is not the greatest but that's ok.

More specifically, I was looking for Korean comfort food, like soups, and bar food like seafood pancakes.\nDae Bak really blew me away with how much it resembled a normal Korean restaurant! They had a great food selection - I got samgyetang, my boyfriend got dolsot bulgogi bibimbap, and we shared seafood pancakes. At first, I was a little annoyed because the prices are pretty high ($20 for samgyetang), but I do have to say that the portions are massive, so the price is actually reasonable. Plus, now we have tons of leftovers!\n\nOverall, I highly suggest checking this place out!

Mostly all I have been able to find is fast food, places with very limited selection, or Korean-ish pan-Asian fusion.  Then I discovered Dae Bak and I'm glad I did!  It was delicious, great service, and a comfortable casual place to eat.\n\nIt was a bit tricky to find - its on the second floor of what is otherwise an Asian fast food mall in Chinatown.  But what is nice about that is being seated at the window overlooking Race street lets you watch people outside & below, which is really fun.\n\nThe service was great.  Helpful to us in picking dishes since we don't know Korean food well, responsive, very pleasant.\n\nFood was great.  The small kimchi appetizers before the meal were delicious, and they refilled a few that we finished while waiting for the meal. \n\n We had a seafood scallion pancake appetizer, which was excellent. And our two entres were beef bulgogi, and stir-fry octopus & vegetable \"soup\".  I don't know why they call it soup because its not soup, just a bit saucy, but it was a tasty dish with a mildly hot sauce.  The octopus was decent - not the most tender - but just fine.  The beef bulgogi was standard, and by standard I mean very good in a traditional way.\n\nThe portions are large, so keep that in mind when ordering.  \n\nSome other reviewers on here complain about the prices - yes, its a bit more than most nearby Chinese restaurants - in the range of $20 for the octopus and $24 for the beef.  But given the paucity of alternative Korean restaurants, I was happy to pay it.\n\nAll in all, a really good meal.","date":"2018-06-27 22:13:39","vector":[0.1043266667,0.4889,0.0516,0.4733333333,0.0]}

Last year, we went all out, ordering a full thanksgiving dinner, complete with succulent honey baked ham, smoked turkey, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and stuffing.

The side dishes do require a bit of cooking before they're ready though, but there are great directions that are easy to follow. It was amazing and wonderful and tasty of course, the only impediment for me doing the same this year was the cost (the cost of quality) and my personal desire to try and cook some homemade foods for thanksgiving this year. That's why this year we opted for just honey baked ham's signature item, the honey baked ham! Ours was bone in ham (you can get boneless too).

I love the flavor of their ham, and I love that it is kind of a thick cut of ham they use for the sandwiches.  The pretzel bun the sandwich came on was yummy, and the horseradish sauce had a nice balance of mayo and horseradish.  The service was friendly and efficient and the whole meal was around $9 which to me is a bargain.

We did eat at their previous location many years ago when it was in the Mayfair Hotel but our recollection was faded which is not a good sign. We popped in this past Wednesday night after walking by this place many times over the years - and thought we should stop - after all it is in the neighborhood. The restaurant is located in what was the cafeteria of a former (newer) YWCA that has since become an affordable housing project. The space itself is sterile, relying on the modern brick that the building was constructed as its backdrop, but contains little ambience. Upon arrival you are met with a solid wall, which blocks your view so you must peek around the corner right into the room to catch someone's attention that you are waiting. A minute or so later a young server came and told us to sit wherever we liked. There were 4 or 5 small-unoccupied tables. In the middle of the room there was a long strip of tables pushed together running the entire length of the restaurant with what looked like 50 or so guests, all women, a night out. This cut the restaurant visually into thirds and made our visit awkward as we felt we were pushed against one wall or the other. They could have located them at one side or the other and allowed the remaining tables to be spaced better, no matter though. The same server popped by to take our drink orders - but I told her we would need a minute or two to study the menu when she brought it. She did and came back a minute or so later and asked what I would like to drink. At that point I had the feeling I was going to be eating \"mall\" food so I asked her the same question I ask at any restaurant that purports to think or promote itself as \"real\" Italian or a great or good Italian restaurant and that is: \"which pasta items are hand or machine made here in this restaurant or are made from fresh pasta brought in?\" The server replied \"none, we only use box pasta here but I am not sure what brand - but we zoop up our sauces\". This means canned sauces zooped up.\n\nThe menu was brief, uninspiring, and contained nothing more than what you might conjure up at home using some veggies in your fridge and a box of pasta. The menu did feature some pizza choices - but a place like this likely buy the preformed pizza shell as well.\n\nThe wine list was equally uninspiring - the few selections offered were mediocre, but surprisingly at a price point 3.5 to 4 X the retail price. Now I might pay that kind of markup in a place that actually has a chef on the premises that \"creates\" menu items from scratch or at the very least makes or uses fresh pasta or fresh what ever. But this place has nothing more to offer than the pasta that a Boston Pizza or Spaghetti Factory would serve - and both of those places have better atmosphere and a much better price point.\n\nI normally do not write about restaurants in Edmonton as I live here and eat out constantly. However I want to express disappointment in their limited menu, that they use box pasta exclusively and their mediocre but pricy wine list. Perhaps this place is a cash cow for its owner - minimal effort or quality provided. How was the food you ask? Well we eat most of the week - and there are so many other good places downtown - we walked out without ordering. We know what boxed pasta and zooped up sauces taste like - I use Italian pasta of the Divella brand at home. We dined elsewhere.","date":"2009-05-29 02:38:04","vector":[0.1072857143,0.0,0.0,0.1030785714,0.0]}

Rig's has a standard menu, which rarely seems to change (an excellent thing...nobody likes to see their favourite dishes taken off a menu), but there is always a separate sheet of special dishes for the evening, from soups and appetizers to pasta creations and main courses.  It allows the restaurant to keep their tried and true dishes on the menu, but still introduce new items to those who like to branch out.  Fantastic food for a fantastic price.  No wonder Rig's makes an idea spot for a first date, girls' night out, or a family birthday dinner.  This restaurant also takes reservations, regardless of the day or your party size.

A paid parking lot is located across the street, and I'm sure there is street parking available if you're willing to drive around and look. The restaurant is casual, with small tables and paper napkins, but I went prior to a performance at the Winspear and didn't feel overdressed in a nice outfit. It was quiet for dinner, which was perfect for easy conversation.  Our service was prompt and friendly throughout the meal, and the food was so good.  The menu offers two pages of pasta dishes, with an assortment of appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Prices are very reasonable, and the pasta dishes come in small and large (this is awesome for a smaller eater like myself).  I chose an angel hair pasta with roasted red peppers and blackened chicken and it was outstanding, the chicken was so moist and tender.  My husband got lasagna and loved it as well, which is saying a lot; he is picky about lasagna and has a high standard against his family's recipe.

Cookies from Tiff's Treats are definitely much more similar to those from Insomnia- mass produced cookies that are slightly above average.. You're definitely missing that homemade feel you got from Jake's Bakes.\n\nWe had gone into the store and tried the chocolate chip, m&m, snickerdoodle, and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. The PB chocolate chip was definitely over baked. The others were fine.\n\nYou can purchase cookies individually, or by the dozen. There was no pricing option for a half dozen, which I thought was odd. \n\nThe location is in one of the retail spots in the Gossett on Church building. While it's not very far away from things, it's in an odd part of town. It looked like the majority of the other retail spots in the building were vacant. There is some street parking. The employees also confirmed that there is retail parking in the garage, but this was not obvious due to the lack of signage. \n\nThis location is also not open very late? I don't know if that's because they're just getting started...I had assumed they would be open later, especially considering the number of Universities in the area.\n\nSo after my first visit, I'm left feeling that Tiff's Treats is just average.

Rather than start months in advance and deal with crowds on the actual day, we went out a day earlier.  Treemont was our chosen destination and we were very happy with the food and the restaurant itself.\n\nTo begin, the space is very cool and when you walk in, it looks like the dining area isn't quite large.  Enter the loft above the main dining area which houses probably about 15 more tables.  I think the first floor is dedicated to a small bar and the kitchen.  It's not a concept I've seen frequently but I liked the feel of the place.\n\nWe started with the kale salad and the lobster agnolotti.  I got to taste both dishes since I have no dietary restrictions and I was impressed with how each was executed.  The salad had two kale textures in it, raw leaves and crispy leaves.  Maybe they toss kale chips in with it?  Either way, that textural element took the salad up a few points in my book.  I believe it was paired with a lemon dressing for my wife and it had to be preserved lemon or meyer because it was lighter and sweeter than most lemon we buy.  The agnolotti which were filled with lobster and scallop were also extremely well presented.  They were draped in a brown butter sauce and they fell apart easily with a fork while still keeping their texture enough to be eaten.\n\nMy entree was the short rib, anson mills grits and heirloom carrots.  The short rib was butchered to be a nearly perfect cube, set in an elliptical plate with perfectly roasted carrots surrounding it and a delightful sauce.  This dish was rich, comforting and everything that I wanted for my meal.  I had a bite of my wife's salmon which had an excellent crust on it with an interior that was soft and just melted when eaten.\n\nWhile I found our waiter to be a bit dry, he did execute our service quite well.  He was frequently at our table refilling water and brought our drinks promptly.  Also, he accurately conveyed my wife's allergies to the kitchen and made sure she was aware of her dining options on the menu.\n\nI think the Treemont is a wonderful addition to our well established dining scene and helped us celebrate (albeit a bit early) our first V-Day as a married couple.","date":"2015-02-17 02:46:39","vector":[0.2006809524,0.3384,0.0,0.3401444444,0.0]}

Kids running amuck and shrieking with joy about the possibility of gummy worms in their frozen yogurt. \n\nIt was our first time here, and I was a little shocked to discover that they don't have child size bowls. They have big bowls, or bigger bowls. My toddler didn't really have it easy trying to eat his small amount of yogurt in the big bowl. It pretty much just melted along the bottom. But, I'm giving it 3.5 stars because it was pretty damn good as far as frozen yogurt goes. \n\nI had the chocolate with brownies a bottle of ice water, my boyfriend had strawberry with various fruits on it, and our son had cookies n' cream with M&M's on it. All the flavors were true to their names...the cookies n cream tasted like an Oreo. They charge by weight, not bowl size so that was good. I think all of ours came out to about $7.35 or so...not bad, it fed three of us and we left full and happy. \n\nThe reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there were uncleaned tables, and the candy section was a mess. I realize it's probably hard to control what children do, but there is no real attempt to keep people from coughing or sneezing into the toppings, or any way to keep the kids' hands out of them also. Not exactly what I'd consider \"clean\" if ya know what I'm saying? That and it's probably not a good place to go if you are on any kind of a time restriction. If you've never had to wait in line while a child chooses candy ice cream toppings- fyi: It will take a while. Those are very big choices in their world, and they take it very seriously and they WILL drive you batty going back and forth, blocking everything you are trying to get to.","date":"2010-07-13 05:35:21","vector":[0.156075,0.0,0.4404,-0.1204,0.0]}

I looked them up online and it found that it is a restaurant that primarily sells big round quesadillas in pizza style boxes and is open until 11PM. And, like pizza places, they offer delivery. I definitely like that concept! If you want food delivered to your home there aren't many options beyond pizza. Chinese is an option, but I don't know of any chinese places in the area that deliver past 9, and most chinese places don't deliver. \n\nI decided to pop in there for the first time today. They told me they opened on Friday so the place is brand new. I was the only customer when I walked in, but that of course doesn't mean anything. It will undoubtedly take some time for the word of this glorious establishment to spread. The staff was very friendly and made menu suggestions. I had actually checked out the menu online and already and made a decision to get the \"Smokey Mountain D-Ya\", a quesadilla with your choice of pulled pork or chicken breast mixed with Texas bbq sauce, chopped bacon, smoked ham, rice, caramelized onions and D-Ya's smokey cheddar cheese blend. I chose chicken and got the small size which is half of a 12\" quesadilla. I initially wasn't in the mood for BBQ anything but their website said it was their best seller, and who am I to argue with the facts? The cashier told me it would be ready in 10 minutes but it was more like 2 and a half minutes or so. Very fast! \n\nThe quesadilla was excellent. What an great blend of ingredients! I highly recommend it and I'm ready to try the rest of their menu... and looking forward to eventually taking advantage of their late delivery service! They deliver anywhere within 3 miles. \n\nIn my humble opinion their pricing is a little high, though that won't stop me from coming back. It will however make me come less frequently. A small quesadilla is $7.29, a medium 12\" is $12.99, and a large 14\" is $15.99 if memory serves. They also sell burritos, tacos, bowls, salads and they have desert options including chocolate chip cookies. You can also create your own quesadilla, bowl or burrito by combining any of their huge list of ingredients, and they charge a flat rate per order rather than charging for individual ingredients.\n\nQeusa-D-Ya's has two locations in Texas, and this is their third location which is franchised. I think Quesa-D-Ya's is a very nice addition to the area. I wish them great success! This restaurant already found success in Texas, now lets see it work in South County!\n\nComment in response to Paul's comment added 12\/16\/12: I should clarify my comment about high prices. In hindsight I should have added more detail to this review and I can see why you responded to my review the way you did. When I said I think your prices are high I said that because I generally don't spend over $7 on most meals. I feel the same way about a number of other restaurants, and I do go to such places less frequently as a result. Places like McCalister's Deli and Qdoba for example. That doesn't mean that I think your prices should be lower, you're not McDonalds after all! For a restaurant like yours I would expect your prices to be roughly where they are. I was not trying to indicate that your prices are unfair, and I suspect you put plenty of thought into the process of selecting your price points. I do think its great that you don't charge per ingredient, though I will say I wonder if pricing over $7 for the small size creates a negative mental barrier for some customers but I have no idea. I'll still pay it! I hope business is going well for you.","date":"2012-11-19 01:08:18","vector":[0.0891766667,0.125,-0.1574333333,0.2257666667,0.0]}

While I've always known about the annual Garlic Festival in April, I feel like the Mushroom Festival doesn't get enough love, as this is the first year I've noticed it! For the month of September, the Sorrentino's Restaurant Group (South\/Downtown\/Little Italy\/West\/St. Albert + Bistecca) will feature the Mushroom Harvest menu in addition to the regular menu at each of their restaurants.\n\nOur first plate of the evening showcased four sample sized courses and a variety of mushrooms. The Zuppa was a sherry infused cream of wild mushroom soup with cream drizzle and a parmesan tuile. The sherry cut through the creamy soup very nicely, and I would happily enjoy a big bowl of this comforting soup on a cold evening! Sorrentino's is selling this soup base for $10 all through September so you can make it at home as the cool weather sets in. Our Insalata course was a mushroom salad comprised of butter leaf lettuce and a warm mix of crimini, button, and yellow chanterelle mushrooms, finished with crisp pancetta, goat cheese and a light lemon vinaigrette. The mix of mushrooms allowed for an appreciation of the different textures and flavours of each ingredient. \n\nThird on the plate was a wild mushroom fritelle with porcini aioli. Similar to a donut of sorts, it was nice and crisp but it was difficult to tell there were mushrooms in there. Last of all was a portobello mushroom stuffed with garlic and goat cheese pesto, topped with pine nuts and a honey balsamic vinaigrette. The meaty texture and flavour of the portobello combined well with the garlicky, creamy cheese! Aside from the soup, this was my other favourite on the plate. \n\nOur next plate brought a sampling of larger fare. The risotto featured creamy Carnaroli rice with a lobster mushroom, grilled shrimp, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. I personally haven't had a lobster mushroom before and was surprised to hear that it is actually a fungus that thrives by growing like a parasite on other mushrooms, giving them the characteristic orange hue of a cooked lobster. This mushroom holds it's firm texture and colour throughout the cooking process and is great for frying. This neat little mushroom also possesses a faint seafood-like flavour! It paired great with the shrimp, and if the risotto was cooked to a slightly softer consistency this would be a great dish. \n\nThe Portabella & Crimini ravioli was another star of the evening for me. Oven-roasted portabella and crimini mushrooms were enveloped in egg pasta with onions, roasted garlic, mozzarella and Parmigiano. The garlic lemon butter white wine sauce was to die for and brought everything together. If you're checking out the Mushroom Harvest menu, this is a must-try! \n\nOur Secondi course was like a surf and turf of sorts, wish fish and veal in sample sized portions. The Veal and Mushrooms was presented as a medallion of veal on a bed of wild mushrooms, all drizzled in salted caramel. The veal was cooked nicely, and contrary to what you may be thinking, the salted caramel added a unique yet tasty dimension of flavour to the meat and mushrooms. The other side of the plate featured Cobia, the catch of the month. The fillet was poached in San Benedetto mineral water and served with sauteed Chanterelles and a thyme and lemon Chardonnay reduction. Chanterelle mushrooms are not grown in Alberta, but can be found in abundance in our neighboring provinces of British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Chanterelles are light in flavour which makes them a perfect accompaniment for white fish. The fish was cooked well and flaked easily, but the lingering fishy flavour at the end of each bite was a little strong for my liking. \n\nTo my surprise the dessert for the evening also included the use of mushrooms! Candy Cap mushrooms have a flavour similar to that of maple syrup, and are typically used as a flavouring agent. The candy caps in our dessert were poached and sat on a plate with a quenelle of Grand Marnier rice pudding and a streak of Amarone jus. The poached mushrooms were sticky and sweet, with a rubbery texture to them. The flavour complemented the caramel flavours in the rice pudding, but the drastically different textures in each component didn't quite work for me. This mushroom based dessert is available only at Bistecca, and is worth a try if you want to try these dessert mushrooms out. \n\nFor the remainder of the month you can head out to your nearest Sorrentino's to get a taste of the Mushroom Harvest menu. As a special feature, every Monday is Mushroom Mania Monday at the South, West, and St. Albert locations, you can enjoy a Mushroom Harvest pasta and 3 oz. of the feature wine for $20. It's a great price to be able to eat and participate in the festival! Make sure to also check out the additional events that Sorrentino's is offering this month - perhaps go foraging, or take in a fun cooking class!","date":"2015-09-15 15:24:53","vector":[0.1550194444,0.0,0.0,0.3182,0.0]}

Luckily, my friend was a Diamond member, so our group of 7 did not have to wait that long in line.  The price of $18.99 for dinner was not bad at all.  Once we got seated, I was concerned about our cramped eating area, thinking it was going to be difficult to leave plates on the side for the servers to take.  Boy, was I wrong?  Our friendly server was attentive to our needs.  He replenished our drinks without asking, provided napkins when needed, and maintained a hospitable smile, something missing in buffet restaurants.\n\nThe food, however, had its ups and downs.  My first plate consisted of prime rib, Kobe roast beef, rotisserie chicken, fried shrimp, and mashed potatoes.  I can honestly say that these items were delicious.  The roast beef melted in my mouth, and surprisingly, the rotisserie chicken was moist.  My second plate was very disappointed.  I decided to visit the \"Asian\" section, expecting to find beef broccoli or sweet and sour pork, but there was literally nothing.  I only saw Kung Pao chicken, egg rolls, pot stickers, a sad array of sushi, dim sum, steamed rice, and questionable-looking fried rice.  Kung Pao was the only entree to choose from?  Give me a break.  I only grabbed an egg roll, steamed rice, and pot stickers for my second plate.  Horrible.  My remaining trips consisted to the seafood area where I helped myself to Alaskan crab legs, cocktail shrimp, and mussels.  The crab legs were salty but melted butter changes everything. The shrimp was expected and the mussels looked disgusted but tasted average.  I did not have enough stomach for desserts.\n\nAll in all, the buffet was above average.  There were other sections that I did not tackle, such as Italian, Mexican, and more, but I will most likely try them later.  Exceptional service and a relaxing environment prevented my rating to drop.  This is a great place for good times with friends and family and a haven to settle down before hitting the slots and tables again.","date":"2007-05-30 01:44:49","vector":[-0.0292814815,-0.0516,0.0,0.0486,0.0]}

I am Southern, and no one loves seafood more than me!  Upon entering, we were greeted by an amiable and enthusiastic host! The decor is very beautiful; there's plenty of tables and just a very nice ambiance. I only wished the food had been on par with the environment.\n\nDisappointing is NOT the word that could even begin to capture my feelings about my visit.  I was extremely dismayed and displeased with the food.  We started with an appetizer, 10 wings - Half Cajun\/Half Lemon Pepper. I want to forewarn you that the wings are party wings.  I asked the waitress before ordering and was told they were \"regular wings.\" Split wings or party wings, as some call them, are not regular, but maybe they are for the young teens working in the food industry of today. The wings tasted like they had been fried in fish grease and lacked seasoning and flavor.  I'm accustomed to places toning down seasonings in this day and time due to health concerns, but they were extremely unappetizing for an appetizer.\n\nThe flavors available for the wings are the same as the seafood, and that somewhat curbed my desire to have it with their sauce, but still, I felt I would give it a try until I heard the prices. Yes, listened to the priced because the trick is that they're not listed on the menu...just says MP(Market Price).  Somehow their MP is a lot higher than other restaurants serving the same cuisine in this area, so I'm unsure where their market is. I decided I wasn't going to take a chance at those prices on the seafood and sauce being just as bland but still wanted to patronize this restaurant since we were already there.  We looked over the menu and had some questions.  I asked about the catfish and was told it was \"strips\" well after being told the wings were \"regular wings,\" I didn't trust that and had to request confirmation from management regarding if that meant it was a fillet.  It was confirmed, but when I asked how many with the meal, I was advised 1 or 2 depending upon their size.  Huh?  You would've had to have been there to see the look on my face.  When I order a catfish basket, I am accustomed to being told how many fillets I'm paying for, not that it's their discretion.   What is that? However, I ordered it and some fried oysters anyway. I'm also accustomed to a fillet being boneless but was unpleasantly surprised by several bones in my catfish and threw the rest away after I grew tired of \"fishing' them out...pun intended. The oysters were tiny and tasted fishy, not like fresh oysters.  Everything was fishy!\n\n My dinner companion for the evening ordered the fried shrimp basket.  Now, that should've been a simple order, but was not. They cooked her shrimp with the shell on, who does that?  All the flavor and breading go away with the shell when the patron peels it off.  So, again, we asked our waitress if this is the way they cooked them on purpose.  Again....she didn't have a clue!  She asked a couple of co-workers and the owner; we couldn't get a straight answer until she asked for a refund.  We'll talk about that too in just a minute.  I didn't want a refund as it's always the chance you take when dining somewhere new that you will not like the food.  My dinner companion was courteous and didn't want me to have to pay for something she was not going to eat. \nAlthough the staff is uneducated about the dishes they are serving, deceive customers about portion size, and the food is nasty, they do not give refunds!\n\nNo one that I spoke to identified themselves but were all very courteous, so I don't know if they were management or the owners.  I have to say that they do care about customer service, are open to the feedback but were unable to resolve the above issues.  The servers were courteous and trying but clueless. They seem to care genuinely; I hope that they will provide additional training to their staff, research the dishes they are serving for the expected taste and flavor, research competitive pricing, and get it right.   We need more options here in the Lawrence\/Oaklandon \/Geist area, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this restaurant as it is now and have no plans to return.","date":"2019-12-11 18:16:42","vector":[0.0842923077,0.2040285714,-0.04905,0.29355,0.0]}

Okay, my rant is over....onto the review:\n\nHaven't been back to Jack's since the first months it was taken over by one of the waiters (someone correct me if I am wrong).  In fact, I chose to take a risk since when I went after the \"buy\" (I heard from someone that the original owner left to run a winery...nice), it was a disappointment in terms of anything different or more of the same. What I recall from then was that it wasn't bad, but not great either....don't you just love a \"lukewarm\" compliment?\nSo with that in mind, and since I am an optimist, my companion and I ventured out on a rainy July 22nd evening....\nI made reservations on Open Table and we got there and seated quickly.  The place had a nice vibe with table buzzing with chatting and laughter around and about.  \nOur waiter was quite nice and chatted up with us as well :-]\nThe appetizer I ordered was the cheese plate made up of mostly Canadian and local cheeses.  Having remembered my allergy to blueberries, the waiter kindly offered to bring me the crackers separately since he noticed the ones on the plate were touching the chutney, which yes, had blueberries...suffice it to say, I DIDN\"T try that ;-]\nMy companion ordered the feature fish which was a halibut...very nice prepared and he even made the comment that he could have eaten a bit more since it was quite good.  It was set upon a mashed turnip with green beans and beets side.  I ordered the short ribs which were very tender on a bed of risotto delicate with lemon.  Desert was my favourite here (thank heavens this has NEVER changed): the Bread Pudding....Yummy :-9 My companion had the chocolate pie which was good, not as good as mine and thank goodness I had room for all of it.\nThe price point is not for the faint of heart in light of the simplicity of the restaurant...however, I wouldn't not recommend it based on this.\n\nIn all, I am glad, glad I returned and would again since it seems the \"Jack's\" Grill seems to have found its legs....but as with everything new, need to go back again...perhaps in the fall? or winter?

EVERY dish we had was delicious!  We loved the tuna aguachili, which was my husband's favorite, (I thought it was absolutely delicious too).  I started with the roasted beet salad, which was cooked to perfection, and while I typically don't love mint, it added a touch that made the dish perfect, ooh and the quinoa-so citrusy and delicious.  The avocado salad was light and refreshing. The nachos were also very good if you love roasted cauliflower, which I do.  I don't particularly love kale, but in this dish it was crispy and added so much. My husband enjoyed the skirt steak taco, while I devoured the pork belly taco (almost mole\/cinnamon tasting). They were both delicious, but I will definitely be leaving wanting more of the pork belly, (if you don't care for cinnamon or mole flavor, probably not the dish for you, but if you do-get it!).  After a ridiculous amount of all of these dishes, I couldn't resist the Cubano which we had to take half of the remaining home. The plantain chips were perfectly crisp and the sandwich delicious. Did I mention that I am mostly dairy free, so for all of these things to be so delectable dairy free is quite the feat. And more than ALL of that- the service was phenomenal, Tim was amazingly attentive, kind, and formal (making us feel special) but not enough that the experience wasn't personal, relaxed, enjoyable, and fun. WELL DONE!  A must try! Note-it can be as inexpensive or as pricy as you make it.","date":"2016-09-22 03:33:03","vector":[0.4486470588,0.0,0.0,0.836,0.0]}

Note: we went in the fall of 2013, but I am just writing this review now. The space looked like an old dining hall, not much decoration and rather large and empty. The owner gave us recommendations when we asked and was friendly enough when we tried to engage him. I had the chicken yassa (chicken in an onion and peppercorn sauce), which I had never had before and was surprisingly good (I had originally wanted jerk chicken, but the owner talked me out of it since my boyfriend was ordering the same thing). The jerk chicken was good, but not as spicy as we would have liked. It also would have been nice if there had been a sauce. Also, the rice and beans together came with the jerk chicken, but mine just came with an enormous amount of plain white rice. I wish that it had either been a smaller amount or had some flavor. The plantains were good. It was hard to figure out what to do about the check (we had to go up to the counter and wait a while). Also, most of the time the owner was talking with some other customers, who I assume were either personal friends or regulars. I would say give this place a try if you are in the mood for African\/Caribbean food and you don't mind waiting\/have an interesting person with you to talk to in the meantime.","date":"2014-03-03 03:00:50","vector":[-0.17,0.06835,0.0,0.3612,0.0]}

Good deals on the grills but you may want to go elsewhere for your accessories.","date":"2013-06-09 21:17:39","vector":[0.5719,0.0,0.0,0.1272666667,-0.11315]}

Since Hurricane Katrina, this city has rebuilt the vibrant personality it had once been known for. Still and more famous than ever, NOLA remains to be the food and music capital of the country.\n\nNOLA-Q is what makes a tourist such as myself look forward to travelling. Fueled from passion and desire for great BBQ, the Chef and owner John was able to bring some of those great flavors to New Orleans. There are two locations that this pop-up restaurant serves in, the one we happened to dine in tonight was inside the restaurant Coulis.\n\nThe food is amazing, perhaps some of the best bbq we've eaten. We ordered a 3 meat combination plate with 2 sides, selecting the brisket, ribs and sausage as well as the cheesy potatoes and the broccoli salad. The meats were flavorful, succulent and juicy. Everything was wonderfully prepared and not over cooked. The food came out fast and John was very attentive to our needs, making sure that we liked the food and had enough to drink. By the time we wolfed down the plate, we knew we could go for a second round. After all, it isn't everyday you get to experience great BBQ. We ordered another meat plate and also tried the pulled pork which was extremely tender, juicy and packed with flavor.\n\nNOLA-Q is one of the most underrated restaurants in New Orleans. It's a hidden gem and easily one of the best reasons to come visit.

My friend who was holding the meetup ended up getting sick at the last minute. She had asked one of our mutual friends to coordinate it for her. Jason and I arrived before he did, so we asked the manager if he was aware of the large amount of people who had RSVPed. Turns out the manager had no clue.\n\nTurns out it didn't seem to be a problem either. The manager promptly set up 3 tables of 8 for us. 27 had rsvped, per usual, not everyone shows. It worked out great for the quantity of seats he provided. Plus he gave us all separate tabs too. \n\nWithin 15 minutes of being there, it filled up to capacity. The Meetupers showed up along with the other patrons who were going to play. I ordered food and everyone else got their drink on.\n\nI ordered the peppered tenderloin sandwich with sweet potato fries. Gotta love my sweet taters! I was impressed. The meat was prepared with perfection and my fries were off the chain!! I can fully understand why it says on the menu that it is \"award winning\". It's a bit steep in pricing, but totally worth it in my opinion. $13 well spent.\n\nJason got the potato soup that consisted of leeks, onions, bacon, and of course, potato. He said it was \"ok\". Comparable to other places, he desired cheese in it or ideally for it to have tasted better. The one bite I had of it, I found it quite good. He didn't think it was worth the $5 though. He thought it had about the same quality as St. Louis Bread Company's. Harsh critic, maybe?\n\nAmbiance of this place reminds me of one of my favorite pubs I used to regularly visit while I lived in Ireland.

In one of the tourist pamphlets, it listed Plaza Mariachi as one of the eateries that was close to Brentwood just outside of Nashville. We ventured over to this location and found out that Plaza Mariachi was actually an indoor kind of Mexican Mall. However, I digress, and we'll leave a separate review for that. But when we went into the mall area, we came upon a restaurant called Madera. Much of the menu was in Spanish, and referenced Puerto Rican style dishes. They started off with dried plantain slices served with a siracha dipping sauce. This was something new to me, but they were actually very delicious. I'm not even going to try to pronounce what I ordered, so I have posted a picture of my receipt so you can see. It was indicative of a Cuban sandwich on a sweet bread. It consisted of pulled pork, slices of ham, pickles, swiss cheese, lettuce, mayonnaise and mustard. I loved that they put the Swiss cheese not only under the pulled pork but also on the top of the sandwich. It was kind of between a cold and hot sandwich, as the pork was warm and the cheese under it was melted, but the other parts of the sandwich had not been heated. The bread had been grilled and added just the right crispness that it wasn't doughy. The side of rice that I got was excellent. It included black beans and was delicious. Our host and waitress were very pleasant. We were seated on the patio and enjoyed a very nice dinner with wonderful weather. The only criticism that I would have of the place is that the server's working inside did not have anyone to wait on and they gathered in a group and pretty much were oblivious to anything going on around them. As my friend and I tried to exit, they were sitting and standing around a booth that was right next to the door, which was partially blocked by the podium and a cart. We had to squeeze around them and they didn't even notice we were trying to leave. My suggestion for the business is to not have your staff socializing in groups. There is always work that can be done. Otherwise, I was very pleased with the atmosphere and the food.","date":"2017-07-08 00:28:34","vector":[0.1781444444,0.1646333333,0.0,0.18952,0.26335]}

I think I ordered a plain sandwich and wasn't impressed, which is why I haven't returned.  Recently I bought the Groupon deal and have been hanging onto it until I felt it was a good day to get a sandwich again.  My friend is a fan of the Greek on Dutch crunch, and since I love kalamata olives, I thought it sounded great and it's something I would never order.  My Groupon was for $10 and the Greek sandwich was $8 so I added avocado for an extra $1 - we called it good.\n\nFirst off, the sandwich was big and wrapped very nicely.  I went to the gym after I left Paisan's so I knew it would have to wait in my car until I got back to work.  The bread was so fresh and not at all painfully crunchy where it would cut the roof of your mouth (like most Dutch crunch breads do).  There was ample turkey, tomato, and lettuce.  The top had kalamata olive spread, which was actually barely noticeable and the only downside - I thought it would be saltier but I could hardly taste it when I took a bite of the sandwich as a whole.  The bottom part of the bread had avocado spread and it went nicely with the rest of the sandwich.  I highly recommend this deli and this sandwich.  Their salads looked HUGE and loaded with great stuff (made fresh daily).   \n\nAlso, the staff was very friendly even though it was super busy during lunch hour.  They were willing to talk and answer any questions.

I quit enjoy the bi bim bap as well but am a bit disappointed it comes with sliced steamed egg instead of a fried egg (that runny yolk is KEY when mixing the dish together). They will swap in a fried egg upon request but I think it's a small extra charge. The kimchi poutine is a take it or leave it dish for me but I definitely respect the creativity. \n\nLastly, the service is also fantastic - they are so polite and remember me at every visit...\"Ginger Ale, pork bone stew, and extra side of kimchi?\"...heck yes.

Well in my case, curiosity kill my pocket lol! I found this place on GH, then I search it up on Yelp. As many of you who reside in Port Richmond, Kensington, Harrowgate, and Bridesburg area know that authentic Asian cuisines are no where closed unless you are willing to travel to Chinatown or Bustleton Area. So when I found Lun's Asia Cafe, I gotta try them. Lun's Asia Cafe is located on the shopping center that sits on Aramingo avenue and Venango street. Parking won't be a issue. \n\nAs I walk in, this place look no different from the average Chinese take-out that's around Philly. As I look through the menu, dim sum section, vietnamese noodle soup section, and rice platters caught my attention. Me and hubby order scallion pancake, pork soup dumplings, Chinese sticky rice, Korean style bulgogi on rice, and beef brisket pho. They throw in a order of kimchi free. I caught one of them take out a pack of scallion pancake out the freezer... I was expecting home-made not supermarket style. At that point, I have a very bad feeling about my order. How right I was.....\n\nLet's start with the bulgogi on rice, I've never seen bulgogi this way. You know what it looks like? Mongolian Beef. Pork soup dumplings and sticky rice were pretty much heat up asian market grade. My mom say the pho is one of the worst she ever had. And the kimchi, oh man... I don't know why is it sweet?? I thought kimchi were vinegary and spicy, where did the sweetness came from?? Even though I know scallion pancake is from the asian market, but they are passable compared to the rest of the items we got. \n\nThey also carry beverages like milk tea, fruity green tea, smoothies, and mochi. I think the drinks are all powder base, so I didn't buy any. If you want asian market dim sum heated up and deliver to ur door, then Lun's will be ur best bet around the area. As for me, it is not worth it. I rather buy my own $20 steamer and buy those from Asian market and heat it up myself, bet it is cheaper lol.\n\nForgot to mention, I order take out at the restaurant, it took them approximately 30 minutes to make my order.","date":"2020-02-06 22:37:49","vector":[0.097376,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

They attempted delivery on Saturday 5\/22 when I wasn't home. I called customer service that afternoon and they first told me they don't deliver on Saturdays (??like what??I have a note with the dat eon my door?) so it must have been attempted prior, and that they would automatically try to re-deliver on the following Monday. Monday comes and I rearrange my schedule so I can be home to sign for delivery - no delivery. I call again, they tell me it will be put on the truck for the next day. Tuesday comes, no delivery. I call again and am told that it will be delivered by the end of the week and that I have to call the warehouse everyday around 8 am to check if it made it onto the truck?? What kind of crappy customer service is that? End of the week comes - still no package. I call again - warehouse doesn't pick up. I call again and talk to another customer service rep who says that they will try delivery on  the next Tuesday. Tuesday comes, no package, I call the warehouse at 8 am on Wednesday and turns out the package is not on the truck for delivery that day either. Javier, worker at warehouse I'm finally able to get ahold of, gets snappy with me and tells me the package is in his hands and will be on the truck the next day guaranteed and that apparently the driver said that my package was listed as one that needed to be delivered after 5 pm (straight out lie because I've never told anyone that). It is is now Thursday - I have called the warehouse, no answer. I called again to talk to a rep who had me on hold for 15 min while he tried getting ahold of the warehouse\/driver - comes back and tells me I have to wait another 15 min to hear if the package is on the truck.\n\nI have told the original manufacturer to not use this company for courier services or I will not use them moving forward.

The server was friendly with out being too obtrusive.\nThe food came and the quesadilla looked super yummy. The served asked if we needed anything and offered to bring some salsa for the quesadilla while she filled up our coffee cups.  My plate had two Benny's covered in a bright yellow hollandaise sauce and a pretty fan of fresh tomatos.

I poured on the salt and pepper but there was a strange slightly sweet taste\ncoming from the dish when I was expecting it to be savoury....maybe it was the cheddar cheese?  \n\nI feel bad giving it two stars when Bernie said she enjoyed her dish and I know I'm a snob when it comes to Eggs Bennedict as I eat at least one a week for breakfast.

It consisted of spring mix topped with avocado, cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, artichoke, and sunflower seeds. Although $7.99 is not extremely cheap, it was HUGE, and was restaurant-quality, not just some iceberg lettuce bullsh*t from shady corner shops. \n\nI also got an order of boneless garlic parmesan wings ($8.49) which was clearly made from real chicken, with a very crispy crust. The one drawback about this item is that it was a bit oily (quite drippy), but other than that, it was delicious. \n\nI also ordered Zuzu's burger ($6.99!) which was ridiculous (-ly tasty!) I don't know why anyone would bother to go to Shake Shack and eat their fast-food quality burgers when they can get a restaurant-quality burger from here for the same price. Zuzu's burger comes with provolone cheese, chipotle truffle mayo, and is topped with both a fried egg and a crispy onion ring. \n\nAll this might sound like a lot of food for one meal -- it is!

After exhaustive research (per usual) for the perfect digs to hang out for my upcoming bday, I decided the Travelzoo deal I snagged for The Old No. 77 couldn't be beat. But I was still skeptical about the condition of the refurbished rooms and whether it would be too far a walk to get to the French Quarter. Well, neither was an issue.\n\nWe arrived early on a Saturday and I was graciously greeted at the lobby front desk, which is adjacent to a recent Top Chef alum's restaurant- Compere Lapin. We were spoiled from the moment they found out who we were. My darling sis had called ahead and let them know I was celebrating my birthday that weekend. They went above and beyond to provide the best service- all the of the employees including the doormen, front desk agents and the cleaning\/maintenance staff.\n\nThe rooms are set up sort of like apartments. We had a spacious studio minus a kitchenette. I believe they designate them as Premium Queens. Granted the hallways are a little dim and dingy but that is the only complaint I have about the interior areas. Everywhere else is gorgeous and immerses you completely into an authentic French Quarter\/NOLA experience. We were unlucky and had rain on my birthday morning so we resigned to stay in the room until it cleared up. The thing is, I was perfectly fine doing that because it was such a nice and roomy hotel room- with huge floor to ceiling windows making sure we had enough light. Some people have complained about the smallish bathrooms but I was fine with it. I loved the rainfall shower with the dark slate flooring.\n\nWe walked mostly everywhere except on the morning we needed to get to a tour at a certain time and when we had dinner in the Garden District. It was about a 10-15 minute walk to get to most parts of the Quarter. We enjoyed it because it was my daughter's 1st time in NOLA so she enjoyed exploring different parts of the Riverfront and the Quarter. \n\nWe will definitely stay here again, especially because the price is right and far exceeds the overall value for a chic boutique hotel in the heart of a fabulous city!","date":"2015-11-19 18:55:27","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0620307692,0.9022]}

I then introduced myself and said I had a reservation, started the check in process then the girl at the front desk took a phone call, then another phone call....11:10 I check in and head to my room, which was smaller than described the floors dirty and a little dusty, not too bad but it doesn't look like they clean as well as other hotels. I take a shower in the morning and yes the rain shower head though looks fancy isn't the greatest when the shower doesn't close so water does get everywhere. I have a street view which is really loud but didn't effect my sleep, but I'm not a light sleeper. My biggest issue was when I was randomly walking through the Nola streets having a good time and decided to check where a free atm was and looked at my account and saw that they charged me again for a room that I prepaid for, I went back to the hotel asked them to fix it and also just randomly checked hotel prices and exact same room for more than half the price. So let me get you the quick details:\n1. I was not greeted when I entered and took 30+ mins to check in. \n2. The room wasn't as big as described(they explained to another resident that is European style so it is the same size just looks smaller...)\n3. They double charged me (when i first made the reservation i thought I would actually be charged then, but i wasn't and just randomly without warning they did 2 separate transactions so if you're not prepared for that i don't know what to tell you!)\n4. They won't prove match their own rates after you check in. If i wouldn't have checked they would have prove matched my last day because you need 72hrs to do it, so for a Sunday I'm paying $348 bit if you checked in right now you'd pay 135...\nI have this place a two when I started writing based off ambiance because even though it's small, the exposed brick and crappy hardwood floors do lol nice...that's it, customer service isn't the greatest, fare practices are out the window and street noise is loud.

The only food we had that was good were the pork crostini and fried pickles. Even the shrimp corn dogs we had were nothing special. \n\nService: the servers seemed clueless. One of the girls even brought out wings without the fries we ordered and told us they had just been put in the fryer....we never got those fries. The manager was very accommodating and she didn't charge us for the food we couldn't eat but with everything going on we just wanted to pay and leave. It took another 15 minutes for the waitress to figure out what the manager had done to our check so there was clearly a lack in communication. \n\nI definitely won't be returning here.","date":"2015-08-09 21:44:10","vector":[0.1282285714,0.14138,0.0,0.2294,0.0]}

I love when indy gets new restaurants, especially when they are new and original concepts. However, this place was nothing more than a glorified hooters with club music. The service was awful.. the booty-shorts clad teenage waitress got caught up in leading on a table of forty something old men and completely forgot about our drink order. We waited over twenty minutes until I finally got up and went to the bar to get it myself. She came over to the bar while I was waiting for someone to notice me standing there (though it was empty) and she didn't acknowledge me. I said excuse me and asked her politely about our drinks. She said she forgot and would bring them right over. We got our food at the same time as our drinks 10 minutes later. The food was subpar at best. Had it been worth the shitty service, it would have made up for things. However it was just glorified bar food. We ordered the gator leg, nachos with ghost queso, and the mac & cheese. The queso was the only thing that was good. I wanted another drink by the end of it but the waitress was nowhere to be found as usual. Another more helpful waitress (hostess even?) took my drink order. She actually ended up forgetting too. Somewhere in the middle of that, someone who clearly looked like a manager or owner came by our table to ask if we needed anything and we figured the drink order was en route so we didnt say anything at the time. He seemed very abrupt and acted as if he knew something was wrong because he had a long talk with our (real) waitress afterwards and kept pointing at us, though we did not complain about her or anything. It was all really strange. We ended up paying our bill and getting the heck out of there. I told the waitress to forget about my drink after she came up and told me she forgot about it. It was just bad. I hate to be one of those people but unless they decide to forego the trashy booty short waitress theme and settle for servers who actually know what they're doing, they will not last long. They just dont have much to offer all in all. Obviously, we will not be back.","date":"2015-03-21 03:44:49","vector":[-0.1202454545,0.0765,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Unfortunately, my first visit to this recently-opened pub wasn't exactly a slam dunk.\n\nCoach's new space is decked out with custom tables, drink rails, a couple dart boards and pool tables, a small stage--no word yet on live music--and plenty of televisions tuned to sports programming. Unlike their original location, kids are welcome during daylight hours and there is no smoking allowed other than outdoors on the patio.\n\nHaving skipped dinner, I talked my wife into joining me for some late night munchies around 11pm on a Friday night. Although the menu includes a full page of breakfast items (served at all hours) along with pizza, salads, sandwiches, burgers, and pasta, I was in the mood for appetizers. My wife decided to be a little less wicked and ordered a salad. There weren't more than a handful of other folks in the place; we were seated without delay.\n\nClam chowder was (of course) Friday's soup of the day ($4.50, small bowl). I've sampled plenty of \"New England\" clam chowder over the years, and this example had outstanding flavor with huge chunks of bacon and clam. However, I was literally able to stand a spoon straight up in the middle of the bowl. Perhaps it sat on a warmer all day, thus gaining the consistency of thick porridge. Still tasty, though.\n\nMy wife's cobb salad seemed small for the price, or as she put it, \"underwhelming\" ($11.95) . It was served missing a few key ingredients, enough that in hindsight I think perhaps a house salad with added chicken breast was what she received. Had I thought of this before paying I might have asked to have the check adjusted to reflect the price difference.\n\nAn order of three sliders ($6.95), including one each of cilantro\/jalape\u00f1o, garlic mayo, and \"Black & Blue\" (blackened patty topped with blue cheese crumbles) was similarly disappointing. The patties were very thin and dry, completely dwarfed by the buns. Although there was plenty of blue cheese, I couldn't detect any Cajun blackening on the meat. The garlic mayo was fair, but I couldn't taste either cilantro or jalape\u00f1o on the third burger. \n\nOur basket of chicken wings was more enjoyable ($9.95). Although a bit on the small side, the wings were cooked properly, there were plenty for the price, and the hot wing sauce was right on target. Less amazing were the shrimp kisses ($9.95), described as seven jumbo shrimp stuffed with jalape\u00f1os and pepper jack cheese, wrapped in bacon and either broiled or fried. Our friendly server suggested trying both styles; I ended up with four broiled and three which were battered and deep fried. \n\nThe fried morsels suffered in the flavor department. The taste of shrimp and bacon was muted by the heaviness of oil and batter, but at least they were fully cooked. The bacon on the broiled variety was crispy and the exposed areas of shrimp were done, but the wrapped portion of shrimp was just barely cooked through. No pink visible, but the texture was a lot softer than you'd expect from cooked shellfish. Served with red and white cocktail sauces, I found the white sauce to be a bit too rich and heavy. Further, I couldn't find a speck of stuffing in either version, furthering my suspicion that whoever was cooking that night is unfamiliar with the menu.\n\nThe place has only been open a couple months and I'm sure they're still working out the kinks. If nothing else, I'd like to return on a Friday at lunchtime to revisit that odd-but-tasty chowder. If it's still thick enough to support flatware, I'm going to ask for sourdough and spread it on toast.","date":"2015-10-07 23:02:11","vector":[0.0548387097,0.3808333333,0.0,0.11074,0.0]}

In Coach's defense, it did take another 45 min. to get the check. All in all, we would not recommend this place for dinning.

Judging from the dilapidated tacky sign out front and its location near the porno theater, I didn't have high hopes.  But Level Room is way nicer and more normal than expected.  It's still not \"classy\" exactly, but a lot better than many of the clubs in philly.\n\nI came here for a friend's bday on a Saturday night in March.  We had VIP seating, which basically meant access to the upper level (shared with other parties) with tables, a less crowded bar, and a view overlooking the dance floor.  Being able to get drinks immediately without having to shove through a crowd was priceless.  Having a place to sit down and a place to watch the awesome hip hop dancers below before the club really got crowded was also clutch.\n\nThe process to get up there however was somewhat tedious.  First, show ID at the door and get a wrist band.  Next, pay the cover and get a hand stamp.  Finally, point out your name on the bday girl's guest list and get another wrist band.  I looked like I'd been club hopping all over the city just for one place.  Then have the bouncer escort you upstairs after checking wrist band #2.  It really wasn't too bad, just kinda funny.\n\nDon't be surprised if you get here and the place seems dead.  We arrived around 10:30 before most of our group and it was completely empty.  But by midnight you could barely move across the dance floor.  Having a large group definitely made it fun; I don't think I'd want to come here with just a couple friends.  But the music is good for dancing, the dance floor is huge, and the upstairs VIP section provides a nice respite for when your tootsies start to hurt.  I definiteliy got my groove on.\n\nApparently, every last saturday of the month (or something like that) is Asian night at Level Room.  Not exactly sure what this means, but the DJ and majority of the crowd were Asian, and there were tiny boxes Fast and Furious cinnamon candies scattered around everywhere (of which I took liberal advantage).  I'm sure I stuck out like a white thumb, oh well.\n\nFinally, it wasn't crazy expensive.  I want to say cover was $10 on Saturday night (but I could be wrong), and yuengling bottles were $4.  Sorry I'm a beer girl so I don't know prices for liquor.  They also had a dollar kamikazee shot special.  Those are always fun even if it's mostly lime juice.\n\nI'm not a \"club\" girl, so this isn't the type of place I'd frequent.  But certainly a great place in center city to dance with a large group - There aren't too many of these.  It would be good for a special occasion like a birthday or bachelorette party.  Level Room, you've proved that you can't judge a club by it's cover.","date":"2009-04-21 21:55:41","vector":[-0.1906333333,0.0,0.0805666667,0.26405,0.0]}

This place has been here for several years, and I drive past it each morning on the way to work.  However, I don't eat lunch out much, and go home via a different route.  But I was tired of the limited spots next to my work, and someone else at work said Cornerstone Cafe had a really nice lunch.\n\nIt is in a downtrodden neighborhood that has been trying to come back.  A lot of strides have been made, but there's still a long way to go.  Anyway, I didn't have too much time, so I called in a chef salad to go, and they asked what time I'd be in.  I arrived right at that time, and they were just finishing up the salad.  Large chef salad with ham & turkey, comes with a 2\"x6\" slice of warm cheese garlic bread, was $6.87 including tax!  It filled one of those big square to-go containers.  The ingredients were all fresh and generous.  I think the lettuce was in the minority.  Plenty of meat.  A sliced, hard boiled egg, peperoncino, ripe red tomato slices (unexpected given the cheap price and time of year) that were flavorful and not mushy, sliced green olives, onion, and croutons (homemade from bread slices - tasted good, but probably the least attractive part of the salad).  My dressing choice was honey mustard, and they included three tubs of it in the box.  I'm sure I've had chef salads that were just as good, but this one was right up there.  The cheese garlic bread, which comes standard, really rounded out the salad - giving a savory flavor to complement it.  A mix of a few different types of cheese were melted over french bread that had been buttered and seasoned - homemade, not just from a supplier.\n\nAs I was about to go, I saw the monster-sized brownies in the display counter.  One brownie was, not exaggerating, the size of four normal brownies.  I asked how much - $1.  Well that was a no brainer.  I even got to pick which one I wanted - so I chose a corner piece, of course.\n\nCan't wait to come again and try their burgers, sandwiches, and\/or pizza.","date":"2017-03-03 18:44:56","vector":[0.0067708333,0.0,0.0,-0.1953,0.0]}

I went to their opening and had some awesome free samples and have returned again for a smoothie. Employees are friendly and I really like the atmosphere. It's so clean cool and refreshing in there. My only issue are the prices.. Pretty steep. If you are someone that is sustained with a smoothie being a meal replacement then it makes sense to spend $7+ on it. But if you're adding it onto lunch etc. it really adds up. I saw someone else commented on making everything completely organic and that makes sense to do with the current price point. I think that your out of towners strolling for the day won't think much about the pricing (and that's why that works here) but us neighborhood peasants on a budget who would frequent here may think twice about how often we do it.","date":"2015-08-03 16:42:27","vector":[0.0,0.4939,0.0,0.4201,0.0]}

I also visited on a Saturday morning and got the waffle, which I thought was great. They have free WIFI which is important for me because I do a lot of freelance work and have used their tables multiple times to get some work done while enjoying my juice. My only advice to the owners would be to try to create a more \"sit in\" friendly atmosphere! While it's nice to do work there as it's very clean and open, the atmosphere doesn't provide such a welcoming work area, as I would expect it to have since there are so many tables available for customers to stay! Maybe decorate with plants, or anything cozy. Try to promote that atmosphere more by letting people know they can stay for the wifi! People will want to keep buying more snacks as the day goes on!

The selection of quick snacks is poor (muffins or cookies) and on one occasion our entire chicken strip and fries order came out tasting of burnt oil and doused in black pepper.  To top it off, they were also down to only 2 fountain pop options at the time which I wasn't told until after I had ordered and paid for drinks.\n\nOn our most recent trip, the area near the steps was sectioned off for construction on the rock wall.  My child ended up hurt up on the trampoline and I didn't understand if I was supposed to go all the way up through the large play structure to get to him or ignore the \"caution tape\" and chairs blocking the stairs.  If the stairs were blocked off, the upstairs trampoline area should not have been available to children.\n\nOnce his bit lip was dealt with, my 7 year old then slipped on the cement floor and got a big goose egg on his head.  The majority of the floor is slick painted cement where everyone is required to wear socks and kids are running around playing.  He is not the only child I have seen slip, so grip socks should be required or the floor should be treated with a better surface.\n\nAt this point we will not be returning to Allstars. It is the most convenient for us in terms of location, but we have had too many negative experiences there to be worth going back and spending the money.  There are many other great indoor playground options in Edmonton.","date":"2017-07-28 21:56:13","vector":[0.16294,0.0,0.0,-0.20125,0.0]}

Small trampoline area. No ball pits, but there are large yoga type balls on top level of climbing structure. Arcade with prizes - games here are good variety, not just the kiddo gambling type. Arcade works with credits on card. Little kids area with one of those interactive floor projections.\n\nQuieter room walled off downstairs with some colouring available for some down-time.

We've done other escape the rooms in Philly and decided to give this one a try since we saw it on Groupon. It was VERY difficult to find. We actually stood outside of it for about 5-10 minutes because the sign is the size of a piece of paper crammed between two awnings. While outside we kept calling the phone number provided but got no answer. Finally we asked around and found our way upstairs. All of the people were just sitting in silence waiting for us. We had two others in our group that he decided to start without (turns out they couldn't find it either or get an answer when they called). \n\nIt was hot in the building and not much cooler in the room. The guy running it was actually dripping sweat. Not that there was much to explain but he only said a few words. When the last two people arrived he asked us to fill them in. The blindfold and handcuff things in the beginning were cool but unnecessary. For the ENTIRE hour we were locked in we only got ONE clue on the ONE tv. I was locked in a cage so I had to call my teammates in so they could even see there was a clue in the first place because the tv in the 2nd room wasn't even turned on! Other places use sounds to alert you when a clue comes up. This had no sound. The ONLY clue came at about 3 minutes in and it was about how to get us out - which thankfully they did because I didn't want to spend an hour locked in a cage after paying $30 to do this. Without the help and guidance of a clue master we were stuck at the same point after about 25 minutes into the game. By the end we were all just standing around talking to each other waiting for him to let us out. For all I know, he could have left to have dinner and then came back when the hour was up. \n\nAfter he came in and we wanted answers he had to keep running to get the master sheet to explain it to us. Even after the explanation we still don't understand how we would have been able to solve it without any guidance. Then we asked for a group picture. All other pictures on Facebook show people holding up funny signs. We were given NO signs. I saw them on his desk on the way out. He then rushed us out as he seemed to be the only one working and had to reset for the next group. We left without the all important $10 parking voucher so we went back up for that. It was labeled \"yoga studio\" which was interesting because that's the business that occupies the 3rd floor. When we got outside we spoke to other members of our group. We both had called at 5pm and spoke to a woman on the phone. Yet when we called at 5:30 we got no answer and there was only a man inside. A review of the place bragged about the use of technology within the room. Not sure how since all we had going on was 1 working tv out of 2 that wasn't even used. All in all I wish we would have spent the extra money and gone back to the one on walnut. That one was VERY interactive and much more fun!

They take room escaping game seriously as evidenced by the well-put together scenarios\/decorations and rules\/intros before locking you in a room.  Much better than some other budget rooms that I have been to.  \n \nIts location is great but a little hard to find. It is below a Yoga Studio on Sansom Street.\n \nThe room escape from Alcatraz is very well executed - intricate but not too hard as to be off putting.  The professionalism is on point, and they really do help the groups move along with the hints they give without giving the actual answer during the game. The game master communicated with us through both walkie-talkie and TV-screen.  Sometimes they even slipped a hint card under the door. BWT, the hint cards are very cute.\n \nTeams really need to work together and rely on each other's skill-sets to get out of the rooms in time.  Pay attention, and make sure you're focused!  Also, it can be a fun family activity. \n \nI hope they will be able to open the 2nd game soon.  I'd love to re-visit it!","date":"2016-12-27 20:56:23","vector":[-0.1292,0.0,0.0,0.1362125,0.5267]}

I like how they leave a huge glass pitcher of water at the table. This is a nice touch which other restaurants could take some notes from.\n\nThe food:\nLet's start with my favorite. Shucked Oysters. :) (From Heaven!!!)\nDelicious and fresh. Many people at our table commented on how much better they were than a lot of other places. They do come in a HUGE display thing that is a little unnecessary. It would have been cool for a smaller table but we didn't have a lot of room.\n\nAhi salad: (My order) Very very good and had some surprising toppings. I wish I could remember what they were but I had about 2 glasses of wine by the time the food came. I think I remember green beans! Ahi was very fresh and perfectly seared. My friend who doesn't like fish very much had a bite and thought it was great. I believe it had a lemon oil dressing which worked perfectly with the  mystery toppings. \n\nCioppino: Half our table ordered this and although I didn't try it, everyone loved it. I did hear something about it being a bit too tomato-y but all it all it was a big hit. \n\nBeef Burger: Friend to my right order this and thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nCalamari appetizers: Very good but I love calamari so it has to be bad for me to write about it. I wish they had given us more for $8.\n\nThere was more but I just can't remember....\n\nDecor was cool, definitely not \"neighborhood-y\" but swanky with clean lines.

We reserved a table for 2 near the front window.  A couple before us was lingering so we were seated deeper inside this one-room shop.  They accommodated us by moving us to our preferred table when it became available. \"You see, you know how to *take* the reservation, you just don't know how to *hold* the reservation. And that's really the most important part of the reservation: the holding. Anybody can just take them.\" -Jerry Seinfeld.  Normally this is the place for my rant about the not-so-complicated science of restaurant host\/hostessing and seating, but this place is really small and, frankly, I feel fortunate anymore just to get a place to hold a reservation even if the \"special request\" part isn't possible because it's a busy Friday night.  I swear I won't become complacent about this though.  Compared to the typical bimbo hostess platoon at most chains that somehow manage to bungle seating at least half the time, this was pretty acceptable.  But it stuck with me so maybe I needed some caffeine or booze for my mood.  So, we're off to a pretty mediocre start, Cote Sud. Service was very good, the food was tasty and comfortable, but not too memorable.  I can't comment on their famous pizza because we didn't try it.  It's a pretty long cab ride from downtown\/FrenchQtr, and we could not catch a cab on the way back so we walked a couple blocks and rode the local trolley\/bus system which was a treat.  The neighborhood has a couple of popular bars, and is really cozy.  The dining room is small, cramped, and nice and dark.  It's a good spot for dinner, but with so much great food in NOLA I would need some special reason to come back to Cote Sud.

It's only open for takeout right now and I cannot wait for dine-in to become available! \n\nWe ordered the arugula salad, which was well balanced and had a nice kick to it. Very fresh and the figs and candied pecans added the perfect sweetness to it. I LOVED the charred broccolini, which came with a delicious parmesan cream. The pickled chili's really enhanced this but they weren't too spicy. The porcini arancini might be one of the largest arancini I've ever had and cannot recommend this enough. It was super crispy on the outside yet creamy and melty on the inside.\n\nFinally, we went with the traditional pizza since the Chicago Tavern style wasn't available. I overheard another patron say it sold out but cannot confirm myself, so order early! Solid pizza with a nice thin crust and good sauce to cheese ratio. \n\nWith any new restaurant there will be some kinks to work out but nothing major to write about with H&M.

I must say I was highly disappointed. I'm a huge fan of Jose Garces but this restaurant is a major let down. The concept in hindsight, sounds great, but the food doesn't deliver. The service is also unprofessional.\n\n I ordered take out through their website around 8:40 Friday night. I was texted a confirmation that my food wouldn't be ready for an hour. Pretty long time for pizza but I figured they're new and are most likely busy. I ordered a Caesar salad, a tavern style pizza, a Chicago style pizza and a sauce to dip it in. My total came to $87... truly expensive for some pizza but I figured it would be really good for that price. \n\nI finally pull up outside of the restaurant around 9:20 hoping maybe my food would be done a little earlier after given the time. Outside I see one of the chefs chatting with a group of people so I figured my food would be finished. I get inside give the female hostess my name and that I was there to pick a food order up. She looked nervous and frantic for some odd reason considering there were only people at the bar and not waiting to be sat. While waiting to see where my food is I seen two more kitchen staff come to the front, to the bar and fill their plastic containers up with drinks. I find that extremely unprofessional, if you're job is finished I understand but if I'm waiting an hour for pizza why are three kitchen members not in the kitchen cooking? \nI also notice a pizza box behind the host stand thinking it was mine. The hostess finally lets me know that my order would be ready closer to 10 (only because that's what it says on the app, she didn't go back to check) \n\nI go outside and wait another 25 minutes. Finally I go back inside and ask if the food is ready, the same hostess greeted me and she still seems nervous. So I'm waiting by the bar and finally the male host (who was the only professional person in this place) came up to me asked what my name was and physically went in the back to check on my food. Low and behold he comes out with my salad and one pizza meaning it was probably done the entire time and was just sitting back there. The woman grabs the pizza box that has been sitting behind the cold host stand and hands it to me. My pizza had been sitting since I got there to check the first time. \n\nI take it home of course my tavern pizza is ice cold as well as my other pie. Having ordering take out the last thing I wanna do is turn my oven on but I had to heat the pizza up. \n\nFinally eating, the tavern pizza is not as thin and crispy and you would expect, it's still doughy and the flavor is bleh. The Chicago pizza however was really tasty but I don't think worth the price. I also enjoyed the salad. The pizza crust dipper was $2.50 for ranch.. such a rip off and the taste was sour. \n\nAll in all, my service experience was so bad that it ruined my entire experience of this place and would never return. The prices also do not help.","date":"2021-12-07 21:40:23","vector":[0.1277625,0.0,0.0,0.10415,0.0]}

New row homes appeared and the beautiful Stateside Vodka Distillery appeared. It was a mini utopia with the Keystone Arcade and Mini Golf next door!

A beautiful wooden door awaits as you pass the large outdoor seating area and walk inside into the quaint LOR type tasting\/finishing room. Absolutely quaint and bustling with locals and foreigners (myself included) imbibing and playing board games (UNO, connect four). Four beers on draft where my wife and I started with the Form to Table (their signature saison table and drinkable beer) that is only 4 dollars for a 10oz pour. Very light, tart, and subtle hop infusion. Great and drinkable. I next went to the Informal #1 coming in at 7% ABV which packed a funky, fruity and tart (their MO). I think they labelled this as a solera beer which means they fractionally blend different ages of the beer. My wife ordered the Merry Merry (Belgian Strong Ale) that is dark, strong (aged in bourbon barrels THEN white wine barrels) which added a subtle signature tart. The tartness took away from the syrup taste you usually get in bourbon barrels which I admired! A majority of the patrons went with the wide selection of 750mL bombers available for purchase and consumption at the bar (About 6 to purchase and consume on site). Great idea and great price point (15-20 dollars). Will definitely be back to this place as their creativity reminds me of Second District and Tired Hands.

I waited about 10 minutes in a line of about 6 people before putting my order in.  I considered a few times going somewhere else, but decided I should wait it out.\n\nFinally, I had arrived and was able to place my order.  I got an Ethiopian blend coffee and their extra thick sourdough toast with almond butter.  Both were totally worth the wait.

We were warned that our meals could take up to 30 minutes due to it being busy, but in reality, our appetizers came out in 30 minutes, and our mains came out another 30 minutes later. I genuinely don't understand how the owners of this restaurant think it is okay to run a restaurant this way. Why should soup take 30 minutes to come to our table?? As for our actual meal, are you boiling one single small pot of water for each egg you poach? At one point, I looked around at the rest of the restaurant and only about 4 tables had their food. It started to get awkward when our coffee cups and juice cups were being cleared by the waitress and we *still* did not have our food. When our food finally arrived, we received an apology from the waitress for the delay, but.... I imagine she has to apologize all the time. A friend of mine ate here for dinner recently and they also stated it took one hour for their dinner to come out, and there was only about 3 tables full of people in the restaurant. What gives, Under The High Wheel?? I left feeling quite upset and like I wasted far too much time on a Sunday. I will say that the food was good, but certainly not worth an hour of waiting after being seated (then add in the 30 mins it took to even get a table). Don't bother with this place if you actually want to enjoy the taste of your food rather than inhaling it because you've been starved in a food establishment.

If they would raise their game and sell some decent IPA, then I would rate this place a 4- or 5-star dive. The live music is what usually brings me in, and that means Daniel B Marshall, who performs on most Sat nights and, I think, on many Weds, as well. The outdoor deck is classic Florida, and the interior is dark and ornate, like a Victorian Irish bar should be. The clientele is mostly idiotic 20-somethings, completely consumed with themselves. There seems to be a fair amount of hitting-on going on. One downer is they do allow disgusting smoking on the deck, so be prepared for some drunk douche bag to hit you with his burning butt at some point in between sloshing his Bud Light around. One good thing is the location, which allows you to go to many other places within a short walking distance, once you get sick of the scene here. One major major minus, though, is the serious lack of parking around the area, unless you want to valet, which I don't.

Some of the omelets and skillets have less toppings than some restaurants but the quality of the ingredients is incomparable.  I have NEVER tasted eggs so delicious.  I couldn't wrap my head around it.  They even found a way to make their pancakes more amazing.  They were light and fluffy and had such a complex flavor.  Even the syrup was better than everywhere else.  The syrup was heated and it was dark in color.  The flavor was quite unique.  It's hard to explain how they take something so simple, that you have eaten hundreds of times and bring it to a completely different level.

I took a bite of a co-workers twisted chicken wing, and decided to give the chicken a shot.

We decided to use Axxess card and gave Aldo's a try.   The decor had a rustic Tuscan feel, especially if you choose to dine al fresco.  The lunch entrees were generously portioned and moderately priced.  The food was slightly better than national chain such as Olive Garden, but far from being good authentic Italian.  You can definitely tell that some components of your meals are not made from scratch, thereby, explains the moderate pricing and the generous portions.  Given the ambiance, price, and the quality, this place is right in the middle, nothing bad, but nothing that warrants more visits in the future.  \n\nWe got some complementary French bread with garlic dipping oil to start.  The French bread was typical grocery store quality French bread, but being a garlic fiend, I loved the garlic oil even if it was not made with extra virgin olive oil.  The pan sauteed salmon was served with a olive caper tomato sauce and rested on top of shaved squash and carrots.  The striation and fattiness of the salmon suggested that it was probably farmed and not wild salmon as the specials board suggested.  I was really hoping for some Copper River salmon.  The sauce was savory and tangy, but too oily.  The squash and carrot ribbons were not overcooked and maintain some of their crispness.  The flat iron steak was cooked to a medium rare, relatively tender (for the price, you can't expect tenderloin or ribeye), and topped with flavorful mushroom, pepper, onion, blue cheese, and chimichurri sauce.  The fries was the typical frozen food supplier variety.  It was fine as a side, but nothing memorable and definitely not worth ordering from the appetizer menu.  I have to advice against ordering desserts here.  It was expensive at $8, and It didn't look like it was made in house.  \n\nThe service was mediocre.  There were times when we wonder where our server went, but it maybe because we went during the end of the lunch shift.

As soon as I arrived, someone greeted me, and let me know where I was in the line.  (I had made an appointment, but I was early).  Then it was Julian who helped me.  He was amazing.  He answered all my questions  and was very professional.  Julian even waited while my husband was on his way.  He was very knowledgable about everything in the store, and really worked hard to make sure we got the right phones that fit our life, and helped us search for every discount that we were eligible to receive.

It was in the poor customer service in that store that led to us not really getting what we had agreed to, and for which we paid the price for in so many ways.\n\nIt was so simple..we leased two phones it didn't matter to us if it was a lease or not on them, but we  had been offered buy one phone get one free. Salesperson said there was no difference if we leased or bought our phones over time. It was to be a 2 year agreement.\n\nWe what she sold us was not something that was available, although no one told us that. It was entered incorrectly into the system and could never be rectified. Contacted the Attorney General's Office after month after month we had to fight for extended periods of time with them to get it straightened out for the month but it never would get fixed.\n\nIn the end they gave us credit for one of the phones but then we were forced to be on a 3 year agreement instead of 2 year agreement.  Then of course there is little chance of a phone lasting 3 years so instead of turning in our phones at the end of the 3 year agreement, we then had to pay for the phones outright.\n\nSo that meant we rented the phones monthly and then had to pay for them outright, we paid for them twice.\n\nSo the worker was wrong, leasing is very much different than a typical paying off a phone.  Also, the manager who told her how to set up our phones and account in 8\/16 was completely wrong about how to handle it. \n\nI am very happy that tonight after 3 years of not having really what we were told we would have on this agreement...we go to sleep with no more Sprint service.  All of us here are now with prepaid service that 2 of the 3 of us long ago had to simultaneously acquire from another carrier, when paying off this obligation. The service for where the phones were used was not sufficient. \n\n\nAnd it all started with a worker and a manger who didn't know what they were doing. The it seemed like Sprint seeing the mistake at corporate level, tried to make for it but then added on a year that we never asked for. 3 years? No one does that. Other worker in that store over time agreed with us. They couldn't understand how that happened.","date":"2019-08-10 22:53:59","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.2732,-0.112725,0.0]}

Rightbaway i knew something was off because thia was literally the one and only time in all of my lifetime history of order delivery that i dont get a call from the driver but inatead the store. So i go outside and there is no delivery in sight. I call the store back and come to find out the sriver was in the wrong area of the apartment complex. I then give the person at the store basic directions for how the driver can find my building, located in the back of the complex. Still no delivery, still not sure why im not on the phone with the driver themself. So again i wait for the sriver then again i get a call back about how this driver cant find my building and wants me to meet him\/her at the front of the complex, which i couldnt because i was on the job with a client that requires direct support. Once again i give aimple 3 step directions (to the person at the restaurant rwlaying info to the driver because i guess he\/she didnt know how to call me sirectly) on how to get to where i was located, literally up the street and and a ledt turn from me smh. I then hear someone at the restaurant claim i was \"playing games\" because their driver was being a moron who couldnt follow basic directions, and then i got hung up on. I called back asking why they thought i spent damn near $20 with my bank card to play games about howhow to get my food delivered. I was told they meamt the sriver was playing games but the fact i was hung up on says something different. Right before i was going to request a refund another driver calls me asking how to get to my building. They were a bit snarky about it as if i dis something wrong or wasnt clear enough with \"turn right at specified intersection and go to last parking lot to the left on specified street.

Will never order from there again, and the food wasnt worth as much as i oaid for anyway. Thank goodness i disnt pay a tip with my debit purchase.

The bread is perfect, the meats make me curious as to how they found such quality product, and the compositions are impressive. I eat out downtown at least 100 times a year and can't say I like any other's sandwiches more. I also love the panninis at Cafe Milano and the Cuban at Cafe a la C'Art, but not really more than the lineup at Ike's. It's weird, this place is probably a better sandwich shop than a coffee joint. \n\nThe location is convenient if you're downtown and the place is great for meeting contacts.

I guess, I would not use the term 'house\" when describing it, due to the lack of warmth or comfort. It's more like a coffee office.

No greeting, they just wait for you to order, wait for you to read the total on the register, and dismiss you until your drink name, not your given name, is called. Maybe they are just a serious bunch committed to quality coffee and mad sandwiches, but they need to lighten up or at least add an extrovert to each shift. I give the place high ratings for food and drinks. Service has never been rude and is usually fast, but do they care if I live or die? I don't think so.

It's a little taco window right by the viaduct that screams authentic Mexican food. This feeling is only reaffirmed when you walk inside, seeing a Hispanic family. They reminded me of Bob's Burgers- the mom doing dishes, the dad cooking meat, the son chowing down on a quesadilla with music blaring from his headphones... needless to say, everything was adding to the experience, including the cops who came in and had lunch at the table next to us.\n\nMy boyfriend and I split a carnitas burrito, carne asada tacos, guacamole, and a horchata. The burrito was by far the best, and is probably the only thing I would order again. The carne asada was tough and under-seasoned, but also came out covered in lettuce and cheddar cheese that was obviously from a bag. Where was the cilantro and onions that normally sit atop taqueria tacos?!? The guac was good, but the horchata was grainy and hard to finish. Nothing was expensive, but it wasn't cheap either.\n\nMaybe my hopes were just too high for Jose's. I thought it would be the taco window of my dreams, but it's just another okay, cash-only taco joint.","date":"2014-07-30 17:20:25","vector":[0.0638272727,0.0,0.0,0.1858,0.0]}

(Small cake for a dinner) and the two ladies were very helpful, they offered many suggestions and came up with many ideas. Not only that, but they also have a wide range of flavors and was told they make everything from scratch.\n\nMy sister in law wanted a two tier chocolate cake with chocolate ganache with buttercream frosting and black lace piping with royal blue ribbons and white roses on top.\n\nWhen my husband picked it up he said it looked good. We didnt see it until it got to the restaurant. It didn't turn out how we talked to the two ladies about it. I was disappointed. The lace piping did not look like lace it looked like a weird black piping. They showed us a photo of a lace piping and it did not look anything like that. The cake was really rich and definitely tasted really fresh and good. But presentation wasnt at all how we talked about it. \n\nMy sister in law said she liked the way it looked but I could tell she wasn't EXCITED about it. Because i wasnt. I don't know what went wrong but I wish they did what we talked about. The roses were placed all over the cake and it made the roses look stiff and sticking out so ugly. \n\nI'm sorry. Sweet ladies. Delicious cake. But presentation wise it wasnt what I expected especially after what they were showing us that they planned to do. I will post a photo of what they made for us.\n\nOverall I might go back again but not as often as I would have if they did it how we talked about it. I think I will stick with isabels. \n\nBTW it cost $100 for the cake. Pretty pricey, but considering quality and taste it was good. But not doing what we planned and talked over really wasn't worth it.\n\nI think I will take my money into Isabels for now, because they did everything we talked about, check my review of Isabels.","date":"2012-02-21 01:26:02","vector":[0.141925,0.0,0.0,0.3580333333,0.0]}

I was there for brunch, and not being the b\n \nThe space is absolutely gorgeous. From the couches to the maticulous bar area, I really loved every piece of furniture in there. \n \nMost exciting to me, though,  are the baked goods. Baker Melissa Weller is doing things that make me real happy. The biggest happy maker is that she makes khachapuri, a Georgian, calzone-like treat previously only found in Philadelphia at a very odd and far away Georgian restaurant called My Uncle's Backyard. The dough with handlebars is stuffed with cheese and a fried egg. They are best shared. Walnut Street's are stuffed with feta and cheddar and french ham, instead of the typical Sulguni Georgian cheese. It is $12 on the brunch menu. \n \n \nFor more dough, meat, and cheese, the breakfast sandwich ($8) stuffs a delicious biscuit with sausage, egg, and cheese. I runnier egg or creamy sauce would have been the only improvement here. For a more adventurous option, black scrapple is totally fancied up here with romesco, black rice, a fried egg and a scattering of hazelnuts. Scrapple and hazelnuts is a fun, unexpected pairing.  \n \n \n\nThe cafe was awesome enough to bring out a chocolate mouse dessert to celebrate my mom's birthday that was so delicious it was demolished even though we were totally full at this point. \n \nThe menus at other types of the day are so different; I have a million reasons to come back her. But I have my eye on the chocolate hazelnut kouign amann which was devastatingly sold out when we were there. I can't think of a better pastry. \n \nAs a fun side trip, go next door to the Cira Green roof for a view of the city.","date":"2017-08-29 12:56:16","vector":[0.293548,0.0,0.0,0.384,0.0]}

The waitress was kind and affable, but she did forget to put something in. Steak was served rare when she asked for medium. Food was okay for the most part, though the lemon ricotta bread definitely was too tough. \n\nSo it's hard for me to really say for sure what I would give this place.

The dolmades were excellent and tasty.\n\nHowever, I ordered the rack of lamb, and my friend ordered the file. Both were poorly prepared, lacked proper seasoning, and were bland. The lamb was particularly dry.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the beer...

The inside is beautifully decorated and you feel like you have been whisked away to a Greek courtyard!\n\nWe were hoping for a wonderful Greek dinner but got anything but that for a ridiculously expensive price.\n\nThe waiter at first seemed happy to see us until my elderly parents appeared. His behaviour started becoming bizarre after that. Like a split personality. One minute wanting to please, the other quite rude and impatient.\n\nWe were disappointed not to find Taramosalata on the menu but the waiter said \"no problem\" and that the kitchen could make it easily for us. We should have passed on it. Worst we have ever tasted! It tasted like a very salty, bitter mayonnaise whip.\n\nWe then ordered the fried calamari, it was good. Typical battered and deep fried dish.\n\nThis was followed by a cooked spinach and feta salad. Cooked meant boiled a bunch of spinach plopped in the middle of a small plate and surrounded by a couple of vegetable slices and 6 small cubes of cheese. \n\nTwo of us ordered the moussaka. It was very salty and the potato layers were not layered between the eggplant, etc. they were instead placed around the rim of the ramekin the dish was served in. It was also badly \"warmed up\". The outside potatoes were hot (probably freshly cooked) while the rest of the moussaka was from hot to refrigerator cold towards the middle. It was a very expensive dish costing $27. Most expensive moussaka I've ever eaten.\n\nOthers ordered the lamb souvlaki which was supposed to come with mixed vegetables and rice. It did, but very small portions for an high price. The lamb was rubbery and we had difficulty tasting the difference between lamb and beef. I eat A LOT of lamb, this one barely tasted like lamb. It was lamb but so faint in flavour. The quantity and quality was less than your fast food joints! \n\nWe finished off with dessert. My dad was served a free birthday cheesecake slice which was tasty.\n\nI ordered the cr\u00e8me caramel which was anything but creamy. It was so thick that it was almost rubbery. \n\nNow, we did not complain about the meal as we were hungry and ate it. When it comes to Greek food, we are particular as we go out to various Greek restos and expect a certain quality but know that people have different tastes. The food was edible but not that good.\n\nWe had asked for separate bills but the waiter forgot. I started trying to figure it out but he insisted on getting us two bills. He returned with two bills filled with errors. When I tried to point that out, he got very agitated and grabbed them, yes, grabbed them from my hand.\n\nHe then came back with two other bills, mine looked ok but was missing an item. When I tried to look at the other, he grabbed it and said, \"No! I say it is fine!\" and gave it to my mother to pay. As it was just the pita bread, I let it go. Sure did not want to argue with that waiter. He scared me.\n\nThank goodness you get a 10% off discount for checking in on Yelp! I already hated paying what we did for the quantity and quality we got. We will certainly not be returning there.","date":"2014-11-12 18:42:00","vector":[-0.0199821429,0.142975,0.0520166667,0.183775,0.0]}

The pad thai was decent, nothing to write home about though.  The red curry was just a small amount of meat and a tiny amount of curry - there was not enough gravy - in addition to the fact that it just was kind of tasteless.  poor form.  Far too expensive, not even remotely authentic - blah.","date":"2009-03-22 18:19:02","vector":[0.0,0.0,0.3612,0.0,0.0]}

I always get an extra large bowl of the soup; as I do love that lovely velvety like texture of it (equally as good as La Thai's version just not as much stuff in it with a bit of a different flavor profile).  They have had some good seafood specials that I've experienced here and the curries are decent but not anything special.  They have recently added a sushi bar which seems a bit out of place in the manner in which they have installed it; so I'm still not sure what to think about that and I don't plan on ordering sushi here anytime soon as I come here for the Thai (really mainly the SOUP).  This place has certainly always been consistently good and their seafood specials have always seemed to be the things I've been most impressed with (other than the SOUP and I will come here often just to eat that!!!).  So in summary I think you can agree I think you should really try the hot & sour chicken soup.","date":"2011-10-07 17:59:02","vector":[0.32245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Salted caramel is one of the better flavors in any frozen yogurt shop that I have tried in a while.

The decor is very Japanese, but also atypical of other restaurants in Edmonton. JR signage, a Subway map motif on the menus, and a large, open area evocative of Tokyo station clash deliciously with Edmonton local radio at a wonderfully ambient volume, and sports on the  5 screens. I was very surprised to find my hostess was actually Japanese, and we chatted for a while (in Japanese). It was refreshing to find a Japanese establishment actually employing Japanese people in Edmonton. \n\nThe place is brand-spanking-new, and thus a wee bit green, but they are very accommodating and adaptable. This is not the reason behind the deduction of a star, however. Despite the minor hiccups of of not being given utensils nor napkins ,(and having to filch them from the adjoining table), or the waitress assuming I was unfamiliar with chopsticks and inquiring: \"Would you like a spoon?\" for the bowl of rice which wasn't on the menu, but which no Japanese restaurant has yet refused to fill. It is, in fact for the prices, which can only be described as 'exorbitant.' \n\nI ordered, as recommended by the waitress, the Jalapeno poppers. Five came for 15 dollars. A sunomono salad set me back another 8. It was perhaps 200 calories, and I will say that this restaurant may become a beacon in weight loss programs in the city. \n\nI wanted to order more, but between 20 dollar poke bowls and 7 dollar temaki, I hesitated. There comes a point where the extra money spent cannot possibly be justified. \n\nThat being said, Tokeo station has a gorgeous selection of alcohols. A sake unique to Edmonton (Aizuhomare honjozo) was served in a generous 1\/4 litre jug, and the drafts of Asahi and Sapporo were cold, crisp and delicious. \n\nOn the whole a lovely experience,  if green and expensive. But then, what do you want from a last-minute pop up izakaya from the ashes of what was clearly a failed attempt to cash in on legalized cannabis. \n\n(Unless you can come up with a better reason for the ridiculously inaccurate typo in the business name.)","date":"2019-11-13 02:17:36","vector":[0.0486888889,0.1428666667,-0.02174,0.1101,0.5719]}

To be specific, we were looking for some of their awesome fried pickles.  What we got was the worst service I've ever experienced in NOLA, honestly.  The evening started out well enough.  The bar was basically empty and we ordered drinks from our server, Casey.  She was quick with the first drinks.  A little slow with the second round, but we didn't really mind.  Unfortunately, just about the time our appetizer arrived, her friends (most of whom appeared to be off-duty servers) arrived.  They sat at the bar and we lost our server for the next half hour.  When we finally flagged her down to ask for our check, she proceeded to do shots with her friends before bringing the check.  We were ready to pay immediately, but Casey went back and forth to the cooler, hung out with her friends, and did a few more shots.  I had to flag down another waitress and ask if someone could please accept our payment, at which point I could audibly hear our server complaining about us to her friends at the bar.  The time span between when we finished our two rounds of beer and one appetizer and when we successfully paid our check was over an hour.  Needless to say, we did not tip her.  For the very first time in my life I did not tip my server.  I was embarrassed to have brought my fiance to this establishment, and I continue to be mortified at the idea that visitors to New Orleans are being subjected to this kind of experience.  I lived in the neighborhood (Uptown, in the Magazine - Henry Clay area) pre-Katrina, and visited this bar frequently.  After my most recent trip, I won't be back.  Oh, and the young woman who appeared to be the manager was in the bar during this entire visit... she was sitting with the group of \"friends\", either oblivious to the way her server was treating customers or just not caring.  The one star I gave WOW was for the fried pickles - those, at least, are excellent.","date":"2010-02-16 03:37:30","vector":[0.35985,0.15898,0.0,-0.0674333333,0.8192]}

Looking at the menu, I was stoked that I had many choices and that the price was cheap. They carry sandwiches, wraps, soups, salads, and smoothies. A regular sandwich is just $3.95. You can also get a combo (with chips, soda, or a smoothie) and it's still less than $7 (see pic). \n\nI got a sandwich and smoothie combo. The \"Raindrop Smoked Turkey\", which comes with lettuce, tomato, smoked gouda and sun-dried tomato pesto was so-so. It came out a lot smaller than I expected and I was not a big fan of the bread. The lettuce and tomato were fresh but the sun-dried tomato lacked flavor so I didn't really notice it was there. What bugged me most about this sandwich though was that the smoked turkey was very salty (I don't know how healthy that can be) so I'd skip this sandwich and try something else. The regular sized wrap here is also pretty small. \n\nWhat I did really enjoy about this place was the smoothie! You definitely should try the \"Mango Mania\", which has passion fruit mango juice, strawberries, bananas, and pineapple sorbet.

It's decent and well priced.  Not amazing, not fancy but good and good value.  Tonight, my roommate treated the whole house to take out.  He ordered the dinner for 8, although there were only 5 of us, but all big appetites.  Everyone was happy and impressed.  The broccoli was perfectly cooked, bright green with a little crunch.  All the meat was tender.  The flavors were good.  We ordered the Szechuan noodles and they were spicy and tasty.  There were a variety of meat and veggies, mushrooms, noodles that we chose, along with rice and spring rolls included.  We ordered soup and ginger beef as well.  The hot and sour soup was not the best I've had, but was tasty.  I prefer it super thick and loaded, this one was a little watery and heavy on the tofu.  The ginger beef was great.  All the dishes were perfectly cooked and not greasy as Chinese can be sometimes.  We opted for pickup for a 10% discount.  There's still tons of food leftover, probably even if we were eight.  My 2  year old loved it, and ate a ton, especially the mushrooms.  We will order again!","date":"2016-12-14 04:18:16","vector":[0.175175,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We've had so many family gatherings with this food and everyone raves about how good it is. Now, this is not authentic chinese cuisine, any place with chicken balls on the menu will not be (I've been to China many times) This is classic American style Chinese food that we all grew up eating, and this place does it as good or better than anywhere I've ever been. I crave this place. I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, but have picked up takeout at least 50 times. The dinner for two is really two meals for three people.

Friendly, helpful staff, and really delicious combinations that are very well made. It absolutely lives up to every bit of hype this Thai ice cream concept has received.\n\nIf you come here and watch the process of your rolled ice cream being made, you will completely understand how it is worth every single penny of the $6 you will pay for it, which, by the way, why are people complaining about price? Any boring old one flavor, one topping cup at Philly Flavors costs that much, if not more, for much worse quality ice cream. \n\nThe process of making rolled ice cream is very labor-intensive, and each order takes a good few minutes of elbow-grease from the boys at the counter, as they chop and scrape and spread and roll over and over again. It really is an art. The nature of Thai rolled ice cream also makes it colder, and therefore unlikely to immediately turn into a goopy, melted puddle in 2 seconds, which is one of my greatest ice cream pet peeves.\n\nTip: If you're a newbie, get the vanilla ice cream with fresh strawberries and graham crackers blended into it, and nutella drizzle on top.

I was surprised that the server said nothing about the fact that I had only eaten one piece of that roll.  I wasn't going to say anything but after talking to my friends I decided that I should.  So I mentioned to the server that the sushi wasn't good, and she FREAKED OUT!  She hurried over to the sushi chef and told him, and he proceeded to freak out as well.  Craziness!  They even brought the tub of chittle-chopped tuna over to the table & asked me to smell it.  It was pretty ridiculous.

Perfectly cooked.\n\nBasil Aioli Pomme Fritz & Chipolte Pomme Fritz - Very well cooked.  The Aioli ones were superb.  The chipolte ones were overpowering, very spicy and killed your palate for more delicate food.  I'd skip them unless you were just having beer or other extremely spicy dishes.\n\nSmoked Salmon Tartine - Best dish of the evening.  Crispy bread layered with smoked salmon, thin sliced cucumber, capers, olive oil & some garnish.   Beautiful presentation and just as good in your mouth.\n\nFish Tacos - Runner up for best dish of the evening.  Definitely the largest, easy to share.  3 beautifully crisped fish fillets, wonderful side presentations, I'd eat this over and over again.\n\nCreamy Polenta - Sensual and smooth, great flavor.  A wonderful side for something crispy.\n\nWarm goat cheese dip - very tasty.  crispy flat bread served with goat cheese in a drizzle of olive oil.\n\nPoached Salmon over greens - Sooo good.

From the arrival of the plantain chips with guacamole, we knew we'd made the right choice. Slightly salty and sweet, the chips were a perfect match for the guac. Next was the date\/chorizo\/tomato sauce\/goat cheese\/cilantro bake to spread on toasted wheat baguette. It combines two of my favorite Zing small plates in one and wins. As if to tempt my really naughty side, the special side tonight was sweet potato frites with a sweet and spicy aioli. If you've ever had their Truffle frites, you know they have a way of making the best frites in town that are perfectly crispy on the outside and heaven on the inside. The sweet potato version? Even better. Last but certainly not least was a tartine with asparagus, prociutto (like a mound of it...atypical of most serving sizes), thin parmigiano reggiano cheese, roasted tomatoes and creamy pesto.\n\nService is friendly and fairly engaging, though it's the same people who do counter\/cashier\/food running at brunch, so it's a bit of a strange personality transformation to see them go from hustling, loud brunch runners to friendly quiet, professional dinner servers. No complaints, however.\n\nThe wonderful execution and presentation of every single dish, plus the fact that they get the service aspect of it (more than I can say for lots of the new places in town), makes me wish I could eat something new from their huge menu every night. But then I wouldn't get to try all the other awesome places around. As awesome as those places are, though, I may now feel that twinge of guilt when I go anywhere other than Taste for dinner.","date":"2011-04-22 02:14:33","vector":[0.29375,0.1646333333,0.0,0.54086,0.0]}

I went yesterday for a friends birthday brunch. Overall I really liked it here! They had a lot of food choices, a lot of pastries and desserts as well. On the weekends you can order any food(breakfast or lunch) all day which is great. \n\nAt Taste, you place your order at the register then find a seat and they serve the food. I ordered an omelet with mushrooms, broccoli, spinach, cheese and edamame. It was served with potatoes. They have really large portion size! Like huge, maybe enough for 3 meals. Haha. None of us finished our food. (Even though it was good!) It actually looked like we didn't even touch it. If you go, maybe split a meal! \n\nThey also serve Hubbard coffee!! Thank.God.

I tried their salmon sliders with capers and a garlic aioli and it was the BOMB!!!  It did not taste like bar food at all, and actually I learned that the salmon is never frozen and was caught no more than 72 hours before being cooked and served to me.  That is awesome.  Not what I expected from a bar honestly.  I love that it is a small business and not a chain and that they have great food and awesome service.

I wish I could give 3.5 stars because this is what I believe Taylor's Pub truly deserves, but alas... gotta go with the three. \n\nSo, Thursday nights is trivia and also cheap well drinks, so started off my evening with a gin & tonic and boyfriend and I split an order of the pretzel breadsticks. We got both spicy mustard and nacho cheese - nacho cheese dip was so good. Pretzel breadsticks were meh. Not enough salt on them.. pretty much just tasted like fried dough, so it was a bit disappointing. \n\nFor my main meal, I got the California Veggie Burger with waffle fries. So, I like black bean burgers, but this pretty much tasted like they warmed up a Boca black bean burger and slapped it on a skinny bun with guacamole. I mean, it wasn't bad, but I could've done this in my own kitchen for about $2. The waffle fries were good.. I mean, how can you really mess up waffle fries? \n\nThere wasn't anything *bad* about the food, but also..nothing really great either.\n\nI did really like the atmosphere. It was very much a neighborhood bar with little pretentiousness. And the trivia was super fun too! Also, a decent selection of local draft beers. \n\nI would definitely go back to play trivia again, and keep trying food off the menu in the hopes of striking gold.","date":"2014-02-12 17:51:28","vector":[0.11018,0.0,0.0,0.1405,0.0]}

My friends and I love trivia night Thursdays!  It's free to play, challenging, and a good way to spend the evening.  Trivia runs from 7:30 to approximately 9:30, and you can even play while sitting on the patio!\n\nNow as for the food, it's all good!  I've had a few meals there, but my absolute favorite is the Parmesan Crusted Pot Roast Sandwich.  The pot roast falls apart in your mouth.  It's so juicy and tender!  And the bread is crispy and flavorful.  I highly recommend it!   Last night, we also got the bread sticks.  They're your average bread stick with some good seasoning, but nothing special.  I'm not a beer drinker, but my friends enjoy the beer offerings at Taylor's.\n\nOne tip for anyone attending trivia night...you need to come up with a clever name for your team!  Teams that just go by \"team number 4\" or whatever are booed by everyone in the pub.  Creative team names that relate to whatever news is making headlines that week get applause.","date":"2015-07-17 16:30:09","vector":[0.2006333333,0.4953333333,0.0,0.17,0.0]}

I had driven by it many times and was curious as to weather or not it was just another ice cream place that I'm better off avoiding or something really specatular.  When I found out it was an ice cream shop geared towards the health concious individual, I had to stop by the next day.\n\nThey offer four flavors of soft serve ice cream in addition to chocolate and vanilla.  No matter what kind of ice cream you choose, they all have about 3 grams of fat and 50 calories per serving (which is probably about an ounce).  The ice cream has no artificial sweetners and only 2 grams of sugar which comes from the Lactose in the Milk.  \n\nI tried the Milky Way Flavor swirled with Chocolate.  While I wasn't disappointed by any means, the ice cream was only \"OK\".   I guess you could say its what I expected it to be, being that its soft serve ice cream.  With that being said though, its good in my book because while its not the same as say, eating a pint of Ben And Jerry's, its a nice alternative and satisfies a craving for Ben and Jerry's if you are like me and try your best to stay in a pair of size 2 skinny jeans.\n\nI've been a huge fan of Pink Berry ever since living on the West Coast. Pink Berry has a richer flavor and stronger consistency but probably has more sugars.  And while D'Lites isn't \"fattening\" its also doesn't really offer any nutritional value or benefits the way Pink Berry's Yogurt has a high level of calcium and live active cultures.  I still prefer Pink Berry to D'Lites, however I give D'Lites a 4 Star rating because it offers some cool bonuses:\n\n1. D'Lites offers a nice selection of health concious products for purchase.  These items incluce an organic, calories-free Margarita Mix, low carb cake and pancake mixes, and the largest variety of Walden Farms Products I've ever seen!  \n\n2. Convenience:  To visit Pink Berry I have to fight the crowds of people at WestShore Mall.  D'Lights is a short 3 block walk from my home or 3 minute drive.  Its also in a plaza right next to My Fit Foods, another place I'm a fan of.  So if you're going to pick up some pre-made organic meals for the week, you can take a quick break and enjoy some ice cream on a hot, sunny afternoon.\n\n3. Portions:  D'Lites doesn't appear to be any less expensive then Pink Berry at first glance but when you see the size of the portions you'll be shocked!  I ordered a Medium, which looked like a small cup, but the sales associate wasn't shy in giving me a huge, heaping amount of ice cream.  I was sad because it was so much I couldnt finish it and ended up tossing about half of it in the trash.  I have this complex about wasting food (I don't know why, its not like I grew up poor and starving) so next time when I go with my husband I'll be sure to share the Medium with him.\n\nD'Lites also offers ice cream cakes which can be made with any combination of flavors if you call with a 48 hour notice.  If I could offer D'Lights any advice it would be to also offer some low carb\/sugar\/calorie Cakes and Brownies to be served with the ice cream or crumbled up as toppings.  You can actually order a Sunday but it comes served on an Otis Spunkmeye cookie or brownie.  I\"m not a fan of Otis Spunkmeyer products but if you're going to eat that stuff you might as well head over to Cold Stone and get the real-deal ice cream.  \n\nOver all, I enjoyed D'Lites and knowing the way I love ice cream, I'm sure they'll get to know me on a first name basis!","date":"2012-06-04 17:45:52","vector":[0.1450578947,-0.25,0.1957,0.3599375,0.0]}

You order at the register or at the kiosk, or they put your name into a kiosk where you see how long it will take until your meal is done, and you pick it up.  \n\nThey offer dine-in inside or they have patio tables outside.

There wasn't clear signage by the door and rather than the owner\/employees telling us where to go, they just glared at us. Then I heard the owner (loudly) tell his employee \"go tell those people to move or get out\". \n\nHe pointed us in the direction of the counter where we would order. We went there the girl taking orders was reluctant to take our order because she said they might be shutting down the kitchen because they were overwhelmed with orders. She ended up taking our order anyway. We knew it would be a bit before we got our food and we were fine with that because we had all seen the great reviews. It actually didn't take as long as we were anticipating to get our pizzas... maybe 35 minutes or less. When they called my name, I went up to grab my pizza, I saw my dads name on the pizza next to mine and he came to get it. One of the guys making the pizzas was super rude and said \"I CALED YOUR NAME 10 TIMES!! TEN TIMES I CALED YOU AND YOU NEVER CAME!!\" My dad just said \"okay\" and walked away. \n\nAll of that being said, the pizza was great. Dispute the fact that mine was pretty burnt (see the pic) we all agreed that it was the best out of all the pizzas we got. We just broke off the burnt pieces and ate around it. It was a little upsetting after paying over $20 to get the pizza this way, but I was so uncomfortable that I decided not to complain. \n\nWhile we were eating we heard the owner complaining to people about how a video went viral on the internet and ever since business has exploded. I understand that they were under a lot of stress and were trying to keep up, but it was a very uncomfortable experience and environment. I would give a 0\/5 for customer service and environment and a 4\/5 for the food... so I guess my advice would be to order to go!","date":"2020-08-17 01:54:52","vector":[0.10956,-0.0646142857,0.0,-0.25,0.0]}

I'm aware of \"sticky boobs,\" but this was a whole new reference to those things you women wear to avoid showing straps.\n\nWhile I have always felt smoothies at places like this are about $1-$2 too expensive, I get that they probably need to charge that because of their margins. It is also why I only visit smoothie places every so often, because I'd rather have an actual lunch for the same price unless I'm not really that hungry. \n\nFor this day, the Frozen Goat was just dandy. It had no grams of fat, no ingredients that I did not want and I thought the name was funny and memorable. Besides, it had a coffee flavor and I actually like coffee flavor while not really liking traditional hot or iced coffee.\n\nSince they like odd names to market these concoctions, perhaps they should change the name of the one that my friend Tara had and spilled down her shirt to Sticky Boobs...or is that inappropriate for the Alonzo HS kids?","date":"2016-05-13 02:00:12","vector":[0.4750333333,0.0928666667,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Very clean and very friendly staff. Some newer menu options. A few items have gone up in price point but not unreasonably. (Two for 20 deal is now 22 some items have small .50 1.00 adjustments which could factor in if your budget is planned, this is not part of my review however only providing information)  Our server asked for our drink order and we did not see them again for some time. It was cola and water and a juice. Our order was taken when our drinks arrived, for appetizer and meals. They did not write it down. I don't normally have any concerns about that, I realize that when you do this work all day and night remembering orders is common. However when the appetizer arrived it was the wrong menu item completely. Not even a similar name of item. It had gotten busier by this time so we choose not to be picky or stressful customers and just go with it and enjoy the day. It would have be nice to get drink refills at this time but we weren't asked, even tho we had empty glasses, and we tried to get our servers attention about it. After several attempts over enough time that we had finished our appetizer without the server returning we asked another person if they could get our server or help with refills. They got them. We appreciated it. Shortly after the food arrived. It honestly tasted quite good, but it was room temperature to slightly warm. It was not hot. It had gotten a bit busier since we arrived, but there we still not a line, and I'm not certain what would cause an order being placed before more people arrived to cause ours to come out slowly or wait so long it cooled so much. Overall, nothing tasted bad. We were treated with courtesy. The space was clean and well kept. If we had been given the correct appetizer, had not had to ask a different server for help getting refills, and gotten hot food I would have felt good about 4 stars as we had a nice time talking and spending time here. But I do need to factor those in for an honest review so I can only say 3 stars, a mostly satisfying but in no rush to return, feeling.","date":"2018-05-31 06:15:38","vector":[-0.1059333333,0.22342,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

This was once a dive with satisfied regulars that now seems like a fledgling restaurant looking to find its place. Where you once had dartboards and a bare-bones inside, you'll now find restaurant seating and higher drink prices. \n\nI once sold the idea of coming here as that fun dive bar that has cheap drinks and friendly people; while the bartenders are still friendly, the last few times I walked in, it didn't feel like the place I had come to love (and the drinks are much pricier).\n\nThis doesn't mean all is bad. I understand the food to be great (but that's never why I ever wanted to come here, so I don't know firsthand). They have rotating taps with beer from local breweries and have contests every now and again. It has much of the feel of a restaurant\/bar that you might find at Park Place or some restaurant district except that it still has a rough exterior, surrounded by an unsavory neighborhood...\n\nI can't recommend Driftwood with the same enthusiasm I previously could have because I just don't recognize it anymore...and now I need to find a new dive bar on the East Side.","date":"2015-04-08 20:13:44","vector":[0.32115,0.7506,0.0,0.1865166667,0.0]}

The veggie ball and garlic cream sauce was excellent. The beef ball w\/spicy bolognese was average - the worst of what I ordered. The mac and queso was off the hook.\n\nMy server got it done. She was friendly, she was knowledgable about the menu and she would show up at my table at the moment I even thought of needing something. \n\nThe four meatballs and mac & queso (and complementary two pieces of bread) were a lot of food.

When I heard that a meatball shop was moving in on Mass Ave, I thought it would be a little too kitsch and a little too specific to succeed. I was very wrong. \n\nMimi Blue offers all sorts of meat (and non-meat!) balls, and it's fun to mix and match. And if you're imagining that it's just going to be another Italian place with noodles and meatballs you are very mistaken (though that's definitely an option, if that's your thing). Using a laminated order sheet and a dry erase marker, you mark which types of meatballs you'd like- beef, vegetarian, turkey, pork\/beef mix, or the special, and what you'd like them served with- noodles, on a sandwich, stand alone, etc. I enjoy ordering 4 meatballs and mixing and matching varieties. The vegetarian meatballs are to die for- slightly spicy and definitely filling enough to satisfy even a meat-eater. Get them with the mushroom gravy! \n\nDo NOT skip the sides here. The fried brussel sprouts are my favorite in this entire city- crispy and tasty, and definitely a large enough side to share. The mac and cheese is very cheesy, very heavy, and very good. I like to order meatballs and sides to share all around to get a variety of tastes. \n\nMimi Blue's interior is warm and inviting. I've been with 2 people and I've been with a group of 10, and both times I've felt like I was in my cool Italian grandma's living room. I love the open and rustic interior, and though I've not yet sat outside, it's on my list.\n\nKudos to Mimi Blue for turning me into a meatball believer!","date":"2015-08-07 14:25:34","vector":[0.1053277778,0.0,0.6908,0.40968,0.0]}

The \"blue ball\" (tee hee) special was a chorizo meatball with ancho chile sauce; I tried one as a slider, it was delicious.  Then I ordered the sandwich on baguette -- classic meatballs, parmesan, garlic cream sauce.  It was huge!  And it came with some lightly-dressed greens on the side.  I also ordered a side of the brussels sprouts, which were caramelized and crispy and salty, yum.  I ended up taking half the sandwich and side home for lunch the next day.\n\nMy one recommendation is that they add a pesto sauce option, to their regular rotation.  It would go with all the different types of meatball and add a second green sauce option (for those of us who do not like cilantro).\n\nAlso, the food came out very quickly, and the service was excellent.","date":"2015-03-04 19:54:00","vector":[0.07224,0.0,0.0,0.28595,0.0]}

However, it failed to live up to my lofty expectations.\n\nThe space itself is beautiful.   I could spend some time here just sitting at the bar and taking in the deep-hued woods and interesting artwork (Don't miss the giant Jack Dempsey mural behind the bar).\n\nThe menu seems a little limited to me.   There are 4 regular meatballs (classic, turkey, vegetarian, beef) and a daily meatball special.   \n\nYou order by marking on a dry-erase menu.   Basically you figure out how many meatballs you want, what kind, what sauce, cheese, bread, and a la carte side items.   I figure the best way to test their meatball acumen is by having the consummate meatball dish: a classic meatball (beef & sausage blend) sandwich (baguette) with marinara sauce and parmesan cheese.   It was pretty good ('balls were a little dry, but seasoned OK), but I can't say it was noticeably better than any other meatball sandwich I've had in Indianapolis.\n\nWhat really brings the rating down was the service.   Other than the hostess (who seated us promptly and with a smile), it was downright abysmal.\n\nAfter placing our orders, our drinks and food were brought out and that was the extent of our interaction with the staff.   No one asked if we need anything and I was never offered a refill for my non-alcoholic beverage (the table behind us was offered refills on their beers several times).   We had to flag down a harried busboy to get us take-home boxes and to locate our server so we could pay our bill.\n\nApparently our server was in training so I can't place the full blame on her.   However, her trainer should have been keeping track of her tables and ensuring that customers were having their needs met.   The restaurant was not busy at all on a Sunday night (maybe 4 or 5 tables of 2 to 4 people) so there was no excuse.\n\nThe final straw was that when I got my bill back with my credit card, there was no pen (I speculate that was done on purpose so that I couldn't fill out the comment card that comes with every check).\n\nOther than the cool interior, this really seems like it should be a food truck instead of a full service restaurant.   At least with a food truck, the lack of service is fully expected.","date":"2015-06-08 18:51:08","vector":[0.09428,0.0568333333,0.3818,0.1621625,0.0]}

I've now eaten there three times and have loved the food every time. The staff seems to love what they're doing. While the food can take a while to come out, it's worth the wait. \n\nFor my first visit, I tried the classic (beef and sausage) with their bolognese and mashed potatoes and it was isanely deliecious!

I am not the biggest fan of ground turkey but I decided to be a little healthier and went for it. I was not dissappointed. And the mac and queso was worth every bit of guilty pleasure. \n\nIn my third venture (I live close ok) I went for the beef with mushroom gravy and Brussel sprouts. Again, I loved the meal. It wasn't my favorite that I've had, but it was still good.

The restaurant has only about 5 tables inside, but more outside on a front patio. I ordered the nachos with chicken and they were underwhelming. The queso was not very good and the chicken on the chips was sparse. Overall it was fine, but I wouldn't eat here again. $12 for mediocre nachos aren't worth it.

It's a beautiful space but it's full of douchey people who obviously don't have respect for it. The bathrooms were DISGUSTING. On top of that, these people are effing shady with their wine prices. Most places add the tax into the price on the menu - so when you pay $14 for a glass of wine it's because the taxes are stupid high for restaurants. Well, imagine ordering a $14 glass of wine and then you get your bill and it has an additional $4 tax on it. Add a tip and you just spend $20 for a glass of wine that probably cost $5. Super shady. Just because you're some fancy new trendy hotel with a rooftop bar doesn't mean it's ok to jack up prices like that. It's a shame really.

We recently moved to Nashville and some friends wanted to check out the fabulous view. I ordered two cocktails and a glass of wine, which turned out to be $50 before tip. The drinks were pretty good, but TINY. I expect these prices in a place like this but still disappointing. They do have a unique menu, but the drinks are quite small for the price. My boyfriend and I split the Korean hot chicken sliders & venison poppers. The fries were the best part, which were quite good. The \"hot chicken\" sliders were not spicy at all or hot chicken. The sauce was like non-spicy buffalo sauce. They were okay but not worth $16. The venison poppers were flabby and a small appetizer for $12. My friends had the truffle fries, which were amazing, but who wants to pay $12 for fries, even if they are truffle? I left still quite hungry and expected more from a John Besh establishment. Our 2 appetizers, one beer and one more cocktail were $70. If you are hungry, try the burger. Our friends had it, and it actually looked tasty and was larger. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, though. This place is fun and has a great view.

While reading Rimedios website and looking at the amazing food pictures my mouth watered and i decided I had to come here.\nI rarely venture out to WPhilly but I've been wanting to try out dinner in that area for some time now Groupon saved the day. Rimedio is a quaint BYOB located on 45th and Spruce. The indoor space is cute and pristine and there are a few sidewalk tables for those who like to people watch. We grabbed up a table outside since the sun was on its way down and it was no longer hell on earth outside.\nThe menu isn't very large and I'm a fan of smaller menus when the preparation of ingredients is executed correctly and leaves me not wanting something more. Unfortunately this wasn't the case at Rimedio.  For starters we shared the white radish salad with ricotta salata and the scallops. The scallops came 4 to a plate with fava beans and bacon foam. There were seasoned well, seared to perfection and though a little underdone were quite good.  The radish salad had slightly lemony vinaigrette and was tossed with pickled red onion and arugula. The salad was good but needed pepper and I never got any so I ate it without. \nFor entr\u00e9es we both opted for pasta (you know since this is an Italian restaurant) I chose the langostino risotto and my dining companion decided on the spinach manicotti. The risotto was not risotto. Though made with Arborio rice it was not creamy cheesy or flavorful at all. It tasted undercooked and though came out hot was not good at all. The manicotti was much better and had a medley of spring veggies mixed in with the sauce. I clearly chose the wrong thing.  \nDessert was a disaster the vegan chocolate cake wasn't at all what I expected even for a vegan dessert. It was way too dense and tasted like a diet slice of fake chocolate. I will say that the toffee brittle that came along side it was delish and the strawberries sliced in between the cakes layers helped with digestion.\nThe best part of this meal was the apps. The service here was great but the food just didn't stand out. They apparently serve up brunch so I might have to come back to give that a try but I doubt I will be back for dinner anytime soon.","date":"2012-06-11 17:58:02","vector":[0.079744,0.3612,0.0,0.1529333333,0.0]}

First time we had a Groupon Coupon, and first time ever we thought this place will NOT need Groupon from now on.  We enjoyed the Gazpacho, as everyone does, thought it was better than anywhere else.  Previously, my husband had the rack of lamb and rated it best in city.  Tonight we both agreed we had never had better of the dishes we had.  Most amazing, for me, was my dish, the trout.  Grilled very simply with herbed olive oil, Granny Smith Apples, (how did they make them so tasty?) and arugula  and fennel salad with a pleasant dressing.  Both sides were just wonderful with the trout.  My husband had skirt steak, just unbelievably tasty potatoes, very nice broccoli rabe (being Philadelphians, you know we know great broccoli rabe,)  Meant to mention that our first course  which we split, was a pasta with crab and sausage and fresh, great, Jersey tomatoes. Could have LOVED it for a dish, but we wanted to try a new first course.   If the chef had come out, for any reason, we would have given him a standing ovation.  \n\nAlso, if anyone did not appreciate, as we did, three times, the service, they must be spoiled brats.  Our waiter each time was way outstanding, and probably different each time.

While their menu offers a variety of things, including sandwiches and pasta, this review is completely based on the pizza as it's the only thing I've had (and the only thing you need to have, it's that good).\n\nUpon moving to the neighborhood awhile back, I was bummed to find so many mediocre (or worse) pizza joints.  Then I tried Trios and new I found my place!  They offer two types of pizza, round and square.  Both are good but get the square.  The crust is thin and crispy, not at all like the Sicilian style you typically think of when you hear square pizza.  The sauce is chunky and the fresh mozzarella is melted to perfection.\n\nIf you're able to pick it up, do so.  Delivery can take forever and your pizza won't always be hot when it arrives.  The only other con is the price.  $16-18 for a pizza is pretty pricey.

Some of the staff seemed a little overwhelmed, but they weren't afraid to ask someone else if they didn't have an answer. They had only been open two full days, so we were impressed. \n\nI had the 4oz True North with no sauce, because mayo is nasty, with added tomatoes, and Shawn had the Hawaiian type one with added mango relish.

Low and behold somehow the connecting pins broke. Now when I first got the phone I got the equipment replacement plan. Last year right after I got the phone it had to be replaced after the stylus broke. I took it to the store and they replaced it no questions asked. This time however, I show up right when the store opens. Not only do they make me wait almost an hour for a tech person to help us (I don't know why either), when he does he tells us that we need to file a claim online and that it would be shipped. Of course this means on a Saturday I would not get the phone until Monday. \n\nFirst off - if that's what I needed to do why did the guy that put me on the wait list not tell me to do that after looking at the phone and noticing the same damage? So when we asked him what am I supposed to do for a phone until then the guy says \"you might try a pawn shop\" really?? Sprint is telling me to go to a PAWN SHOP for a replacement phone? We had discussed upgrading our phones to the new S7 Edge so we asked the guy if we were eligible for an upgrade. He looked up and said \"he didn't know, call customer service\" - now when we first signed up we were immediately told we could upgrade. How can you be CUSTOMER SERVIVCE in a SPRINT STORE and NOT have access to my account info?\n\nSo we were pretty upset we got literally no service after waiting for an hour. I got home, found the site for filing claims, filed a claim and low and behold what did it tell me to do?? GO TO A SPRINT STORE AND GET THE PHONE REPLACED! So now I have to go BACK to the Sprint store tomorrow, hope I don't have to wait another hour, and try to convince them that THEIR OWN INSURANCE SITE is telling ME to go back THERE for a replacement. \n\nIf my phone is not replaced right there tomorrow we are switching to T-Mobile.","date":"2016-09-10 19:23:26","vector":[0.0,0.100475,0.0,-0.2732,0.0]}

The first time I ordered they messed up my order and gave me the wrong entree, but the spinach naan was good so I decided to try them again. This time when I opened up my spinach naan, it had a red filling, so clearly not spinach, but there is a tomato naan on their menu, so I figured fine, as long as its good, i'll accept it. I take a bite and have an immediate allergic reaction and I can feel the crunch and know I've eaten nuts. There is a naan on their menu that has raisins and cashews in it, this is definitely the raisin naan but someone obviously put cashews in it. I try calling the restaurant and am sent straight to voicemail. So i start a chat with eat24.com The representative tells me they've spoken with the restaurant and the restaurant says that they don't have a naan with cashews, as if we can't read menu. Then they tell me they can bring the spinach naan but it will take 2.5 hours for redelivery. 2.5 hours for some bread thats probably already pre-made and delivery to a house 5 minutes away? That or a credit. Because they claim to have given me what I requested. This was after I sent the eat24 customer support a picture of the clearly RED naan. So I said fine, since they want to be smart claiming a 2.5hr redelivery time, knowing that they close in 30 mins, I want the redelivery and they can come pick up this naan they claim is spinach. That changed their tune and I got a refund instead of an eat24 credit. It was absolutely ridiculous all I had to go through for a $6 refund. I spent over $25 with them each time I ordered, why would I make up an allergic reaction for $6.

I do eat meals there as well - the portions are huge, and the price range is in the upper level for how regularly I go and for the humble nature of my job's salary, so my fiancee and I usually share an entree and are full afterwards.

At that point Too $hort still wasn't in the building and the DJ had completely abandoned the stage because everyone kept on booing him.

Nothing to talk about, nothing to write about, just a dark, dingy bar off Wells. Well after this last visit, my opinion has totally changed. \n\nI'm not sure how recently it happened, but Jub Jub's bought the space next door, and in my mind I now think of them more as a live music and performance venue and less of just a bar. I would never have known any of this had we not been invited to see a show there on Valentine's Day. This new venue is really cool with exposed brick walls, theatrical lighting, and two stages in the horizontally oriented space. The \"theater\" is separate from the bar next door, with it's own entrance around the corner, which is great for crowd control and ticketing.\n\nWe saw \"Hazards of Love\", a rock opera based on the music of The Decemberists. The show was awesome, and essentially was about star crossed lovers. A mythical male faun creature, similar to Mr. Tumnus, fell in love with a human girl. The wretched maternal figure was none to pleased with this, and did her best to put an end to it by sending an evil human to capture and enslave the girl. In the end, the faun and the girl gave their lives simply so they could be together in love. \n\nIt was a wonderful story for Valentine's Day and the set and costumes gave it a great fantasy feel. What really set it off though was the music, all coming from a live band set on the stage at the back of the room, who were all dressed in steampunky costumes. The musicians were incredibly talented, and the singers voices added incredible life and color to each character and scene in the show. \n\nAfter seeing this performance, I'm excited to see what else they bring to the venue. Before I thought Jub Jub's was a dive known for loud heavy metal, but this totally changed my view. Having another place for community theater and other performance events is exactly what we need and I'll be watching their schedule to see what's next!","date":"2014-02-27 20:12:07","vector":[0.0,-0.6249,0.0,0.2560428571,0.0]}

We tried the \"Young Chop\"; American cheddar, bodega sauce,house pickle n pepper relish, iceberg,tomato AND \"Korean-Abdul Jabbar\"; Brie, Thanh Thanh kimchi, Yali pear,gochujang mayo, scallion, toasted\nsesame seed.

They were so crispy and flavourful.  Try them if you can get them - I will go back just for the tots! \n\nMayday is also known for their milkshakes.

I ordered the Dan Dan noodles, Pork dumplings in chili oil, and the iced jelly dessert. Everything is ahhhmazing! I will definitely be back for more.

I had heard ok reviews on the food - but that it was kinda dingy.  I don't mind a dingy dining room if it's reminiscent of a crab \"shack\"  but this place was more of \"too cheap to renovate and too lazy to clean.\"  I should have turned around right after stepping in the door.  The smell that hits you isn't seafood but rather old, wet, moldy, rotten wood.  The kind of stink that comes from an old restaurant that hasn't been cleaned or updated since World War II.  It was dank and musty.  However, still wanting the crabs we'd hoped for - we were escorted to the back dining room.  Sat there for a long time before anyone came to us - even though there was only one other table in the whole place.  The food took a long time - the cooks were really unkempt and pretty gross themselves (in appearance\/cleanliness and vulgarity) and the crabs didn't fall too far from the tree.  Definitely frozen-but detrimentally so.  Frost bitten..thawed..frozen again tasted like a freezer.  Very little seasoning, and overcooked mush meat.  The Clams casino were nothing but rubbery teeny clams covered in bacon & too many green peppers.  The shrimp were just frozen shrimp steamed with seasoning- not awful but not impressive.  For a seafood place, particularly a \"crab house\" - they should know how to cook crabs.  \nOne more note:  the floor slopes between the front and back dining rooms - the floor was wet and I damn near fell. \nPerhaps you could spare a few bucks Mr. Snockey and invest in some non-skid traction before someone hurts themselves.","date":"2011-10-27 19:11:08","vector":[0.0243333333,0.0296,0.0,-0.07006,0.0]}

The biscuits were some of the best I have ever had, freshly baked, light and delicious! The migas was delectable, I highly recommend it. Get it with chorizo if pig is your thing! We also ordered a side of mushroom gravy which was savory, flavorful and scrumptious (we ordered it both days just for our biscuits we loved it so much!!) My other half ordered a crawfish omelet the first day which he said the crawfish sauce was amazing and there were big chunks of real crawfish in it. He also said the grits were by far the best he's ever had. The second day he ordered the migas with no chorizo but had lump crab added (not on menu but they accommodated this request with a smile) he too thought the migas was delectable. The homefries were nothing to write home about but the other parts of the breakfast made up for what the homefries were lacking. Another great thing about Surrey's is the fresh squeezed juice. We tried a grapefruit juice with ginger the first day (some of the best and freshest grapefruit juice ever); on the second day a lemonade with ginger and limeade.

MacDill many times over the last 12 plus years as it is close by and parking is never an issue. If I had to wish one thing it is that they plant oak trees (maybe live oaks as they live forever\/hardy) around the edges of the parking lot and in the parking lot to provide more shade and beautify what is basically a strip mall\/best time to do that would be during rainy season starting in May.\n\nPros\n1) I am not that old yet (do have white\/gray hair) but have had carpel tunnel surgery on both hands and now cubical tunnel syndrome in one hand (PAINFUL). I can still carry my own boxes inside 99% of the time but twice in the last 3 years, my hand really hurt and a young man inside UPS carried my box inside.\n\n2) OK so UPS prices have increased - so has inflation, gasoline, rent, etc. Use the US post office next time and their prices went up also (while giving Amazon.com a steep discount on shipping) and charging Amazon company competitors and all USA taxpayer customers higher shipping prices and a price hike each year.   Oh..and FYI, ALL USA taxpayers pay for Chinese products to be shipped to the USA for free because China is considered an evolving country.\n\n3) UPS has never lost a package and I rarely pay for insurance. When I lived in TX, FedEx lost an expensive package in Dallas TX (hub) stolen by gangs operating at that facility according to Fed Ex themselves and the gangs just click computer keys saying the package was forwarded to Abilene (or wherever) when it was never sent - but stolen in their Dallas hub. I never used Fed Ex again and never will. UPS all the way.\n\n4) I have personally never experienced a rude customer service person at the UPS S. MacDill Rd location. The UPS store on MacDill AFB does have the occasional rude clerk which is why I don't use them as much even though they are closer.\n\n5) The UPS on South MacDill Rd usually has 2-3 people working inside when I go in and one of them will immediately go to the counter when I walk in. Unlike the MacDill AFB UPS store which has 2 people working there and several times I had to stand around scratching my butt (sarcasm) and wait for one of them to get around to walking up to the counter to help me.\nI would rather drive a bit longer to the S. MacDill UPS and get in and out quickly with no rude clerks than go to the MacDill AFB UPS.  \n\n6) Their prices to send a fax are high but with so many free fax facilities on-line why pay UPS or anyone else. I do not.   \n\n7) There is rarely a line so I am in and out of the building quickly. Even when Covid first hit and I had to wait outside the S. MacDill Road UPS as only like 2 customers or so could be inside at a time and sometimes a husband\/wife would be inside taking up 1 customer slot but I didn't mind...at least I could go inside UPS eventually (ahhh lovely air conditioning) and the people at the register are quick. UPS was nothing like that God awful South Dale Mabre Sherwin Williams paint store during Covid at its worst where the douchebag Sherwin Williams clerks locked the doors and made everyone stay permanently outside IN THE SUN and call on your cell to them inside to place your order, and give your credit card number over the phone outside in the parking lot where other customers could hear you (and hear your credit card number) and then wait around in the boiling hot parking lot for Sherwin WIlliam clerks to \"get around\" to bringing your paint\/brushes or whatever outside to your vehicle. Sherwin WIlliam's store has a glass front so boiling hot customers in the parking lot and connected just as hot sidewalk could see the clerks inside ignoring your calls, goofing off inside and taking their time filling your order and\/or bringing your stuff outside to your vehicle.\n\nI have to go to UPS on S. MacDill Rd soon to to drop off 2 boxes. I expect my experience will be like all the other visits ....excellent.","date":"2021-03-31 01:24:45","vector":[0.4404,-0.1019333333,0.124825,0.17578,-0.05464]}

This is always a plus at restaurants. But - the reservations and the walk-ins seemingly need to be spaced out a bit. We were sat at the same time as a 5 person walk in. (We=2). We ordered first and then the 5 top, immediately after. She didn't walk over and put our order in first, simple turned around to take the other order. No big deal, it would seem. Until the 5 too walk in got their food first. And we waited a little over 30 minutes for our two entrees and sides. \n\nSecond) they were out of Mac n cheese! So disappointing as this was one of the items we desperately wanted to try. And yes we had a late Thursday evening reservation, but still a bit upsetting. (Like i said - I'm going to come back and I hope they have this next time!) \n\nThird) the food was fine. My fried chicken sandwich was cold by the time it got to me and lacked the flavor i was hoping for. The leg and thigh pieces my bf got were delicious. Although some may consider it a bit over fried. The sides stole the show. The twice baked potato melted in my mouth and the grits had an amazing flavor and texture. I wish i would have ordered 3 potato's and called it a day. \n\nDrink menu had some interesting cocktails, although I opted not to try any this time around. Beer selection seemed to lack which was surprising to me. When I think fried chicken I think of beer. More options on that front would be nice to see in the future (maybe more Indiana beer options like the ones they have already!) \n\nDesserts - I'll be back to try that pie! \n\nAll in all, this place has the potential - perhaps I just got unlucky on my first trip? \n\nKudos to the decor. I love the simplicity, and the Klipsch speakers! The funny chicken art was a nice touch.

I usually try a new drink each time I visit, but one of my favorites is the Gin Bravo when they have it! Definitely a great choice if you are a gin lover! \n\nVery random--but shows how great their customer service is. I loved their space so much I wanted to have anniversary photos shot there. They were so easy to work with! Just a simple Facebook message the day of letting them know what I wanted to do! The bartender working even made us drinks just for show to take photos with for free.

While waiting a homeless lady greeted me and commented on how she recognized me from the last time I was there and how I was upset about my service then too.

But that was another time. In this visit when I finally received my order the quarter pounder with cheese that I had ordered had no cheese. The lady behind the counter repremanded me on how I didn't order correctly. I've been eating McDonald's my entire life with my earliest memories being around four years old. I know that if I order a plain cheeseburger that it should still have cheese on it. This resulted in the employee getting into a shouting match with me in front of a line of customers. Casting blame on me and trying to pull other customers into the argument to validate her mistake. Why did it come to this? Why not just put some cheese on the burger and move on? Now I can't go to the closest, most convenient, and only McDonald's on my way to work. At least not until the staff turns over.

I could tell the second she started pinning me that she knew EXACTLY what she was doing.\n\nFour days later, the dress was done. I tried it on and it fit like a glove. It was amazing -- on Monday, the dress looked like a potato sack on me and I was convinced I'd made a horrible mistake in selecting the gown that I did. On Friday, after miss gerry's work was done, that same dress looked like a million bucks. \n\nNot only did miss gerry do flawless and amazing work, but she did it quickly and for an extremely reasonable price. She didn't rush me through the fitting. In fact, she spent an extra 20 minutes with me, teaching me how to properly bustle my dress (something that the bridal salon should have showed me and never did!) The bridal salon was only interested in making sure that my dress \"fit\" -- as in, it was the right length, and the right size. They weren't concerned about tailoring it to my curves and flatter my shape. Miss gerry knew the \"tweaks\" to make that turned this dress into a show-stopper. \n\nThis woman is a total gem! A talented professional with a kind heart. Do not go anywhere else!!","date":"2015-11-16 06:55:56","vector":[0.6369,0.0,0.5859,0.2394555556,0.0]}

Usually a hit but when it's a miss it's often by a lot.\n\nHITS:  Prices are good.  I can get a BIG salad, bag of chips and a drink cheaper than just a salad from other places close to campus.  Online ordering - saves a LOT of time when you go to pick up during peak pick-up times (see MISSES for more about that).  Convenient location (on campus, across from both HUP & CHOP), fresh & good tasting food.\n\nMISSES: Because of the way it's set up you may sometimes tell three different people what you want before the person who's going to make your salad asks you what you want (order online, you won't have this problem).  If you go anytime between 11:30 and 1:30 it gets CROWDED (again, order online).  If you go at non-peak times and don't order online the staff might not be helpful (case in point, I was in there yesterday with SIX people not doing anything and no one would take my or the guy in front of me's order).  Occasionally the online order gets \"lost\" and isn't ready for pick up (on the upside they will move you to the front of the line and make it pronto -- this has happened more than 3 times, it wasn't a fluke incident).\n\nOverall, it's a decent place on Penn's\/UPHS campus.  Food is tasty & cheap.

Granted this was a big fight, yet there are hardly any tables to come watch regular football or sporting events. And their \"specials\" and prices are flat out laughable.\n\nThe bar made terrible drinks, were rude and slow. The DJ was playing music during parts of the fights.

The owners live upstairs and apparently, this bar was something that the wife had wanted for some time.  She had wanted something quaint and nice that was still priced for the neighborhood and she certainly achieved it.  \n\nThe bottles of wine are completely fair priced and are of good quality.  We spent the night drinking the Pinot and some of their White Sangria.  Also, you can order a picnic basket, with two kinds of cheese, a loaf of french bread, wheat bread, olives, volpi sausage made locally on The Hill, and nuts for $12!  Where can you beat that??  Their deserts are lovely and also incredibly reasonable.  \n\nAlso, they have board games.  I am sorry if you were here trying to have a quiet night last weekend, because yes, I was part of that rowdy group on the patio on their 7th bottle of wine screaming Catch Phrase answers.  For the quieter game player, they have scrabble as well as many other things to keep you entertained.  \n\nI  have not had the coffee but they make everything you could need in a coffee shop, including lattes and chais and all the other yummy stuff you could want.  The atmosphere is amazing as well.  The inside is warm with large bookshelves.  There are even leather couches in the corner.  The outdoor patio is great as well and really feels like you have made your way to a Hermann Winery and not just Benton Park.  There are pebbles covering it and nice padded chairs and tables under large trees.  On Saturday nights they show old movies on the patio.  This place is just tops in my book.\n\nAlso, the bathroom is just great.  It's a one man show but somehow, the line was not a problem all night.  There aren't scratchy paper towels for you, but individual wash cloths for your hands and the best part, the toilet paper holder is one of those fake butler stands of a guy holding his nose.

When we walked in we were laughing about a story one of the girls had just finished telling, so to start- eight girls cackling was apparently not the way to enter this restaurant. Every single person in the place stopped and STARED at us. Every. Single. One. Since it was all of our first time there (we had been to Scott & Co. before and love it) we didn't the realize the food-serving half of these sister businesses was the type of place reserved for date night.\n\nThat said, they sat us out on the back patio. It was a bit chilly but suited us fine so we didn't have to talk in hushed tones all night. Once seated we were greeted by our server who was, and continued to be all night, fun, courteous and very helpful with recommendations. She was actually so great that I even just got up to find my receipt to look up her name: Christa. She was simply one of the most fun servers we've had and was not overwhelmed by our admittedly semi-obnoxious girls night out.\n\nThe drinks were well made and fun, though a bit fancy for my taste and it was hard to pair one with a burger, though Christa did make some good suggestions. For food I ordered the burger, I hesitated between medium and medium well and she said if I was afraid of it being too pink medium well was a better bet. And when it came it was cooked, THOROUGHLY. Like super thoroughly. Well done. It was actually still pretty good, so I can't imagine how yummy it would have been medium. Their fries were also really good- of the steak fry variety which I usually don't like but these I could not stop eating!\n\nAll-in-all this would be the perfect 5-star date night joint. But for a girls or even group night out there are places that would be more comfortable as it's getting a bit too chilly for their patio and a group just wouldn't fit inside.","date":"2012-12-05 06:33:04","vector":[0.1410428571,0.0,0.6597,0.388425,0.0]}

Great ambiance, great service made for a great date night dinner!","date":"2015-02-16 16:47:32","vector":[0.700725,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

This was our first visit, but not our last.  The greeting at the door as we arrived was welcoming.  The decor was very peaceful, relaxing and inviting.  What a great place to spend an evening. The service was perfect, with great explanations of the dishes,  and attention when needed. \n\nThe arugula salad was wonderful with a creamy goat cheese and beet addition.  H had the mussels and crusty bread and then a burger with crispy fries, just like he wanted.  I had the stack of grilled cheese, adding mushrooms and tomatoes.  The serving would have easily served two people with a shared salad, so we have lunch for today.  The Grilled Cheese was out of this world.  Yummy comfort food with a twist, the spicy dipping sauce gave it a zing.  When I asked to pack up the left over, the server offered extra dipping sauce!!!  Way to go.  Will be back, just loved this place.","date":"2016-01-17 16:54:18","vector":[0.3977916667,0.0,0.0,0.20134,0.0]}

I know he was just scratching it but I just looked at him with my finger one knuckle deep as I requested a Tea with lemon. He figured out why I was doing it . I am not going to even assume that he went back and washed his hands afterwards, He was just not a good waiter. The other server (#2)  whom was working, was good. He constantly was taking care of all the tables including ours.  \n\nGlad I read the previous reviews before we went here. I had more patients for wait time and quality of service.  We were promptly greeted and seated.  \n\nThe good: the choices of burger toppings were amazing, I went beyond my comfort zone and had the celery slaw added to my grass fed burger. Both were delicious. The applesauce side was good. not great, too much Cinnamon. all the food was correctly cooked to our request.\n\nThe Average: sweet potato fries, bit thin for my taste, the sweet potato taste was not real strong. the Ice-tea was not bad. don't think it was fresh brewed. never received the lemon or asked for a refill. nor was the water refilled.\n\nThe Bad: One of the two waiters we had (#1). Besides the nose scratching, I watched him wander around, check his phone, and not really doing anything at all. We ended up getting better service from waiter #2 including getting the check brought to our table. The catchup bottle was 98% empty on our table and the one at the next table too. Really? at a burger and fries joint? Tomato slice had the stem part still in it, lettuce was wilty, and I just stopped looking for more at that point. or I was going to loose the rest of my appetite.\n\nGo back, Not. Had we been served by #2 this may have been a less critical review, but my curiosity as to how bad it could get from server #1 kept  me entertained.  I will find a Burger bar, not a Booger bar.","date":"2014-07-13 17:15:38","vector":[0.181925,0.0,0.0,0.1646333333,0.0]}

Heck, I've made better sushi. Service was just ok. I was only checked on after 45 minutes after I placed my order. \nOnce I get there, I sit at the bar. No one else is there. There is one table that is full of 6 adults and maybe 4 kids. No one else is in the restaurant. After placing my order, it took over 45 minutes before the server even acknowledged me. He asked if I need another drink, I declined but asked for my food. He returned shortly after with half of my order. The rest didn't follow for another 15 minutes. After that someone whom I assume is the owner came out to apologize and offered me a drink. I initially declined, she offered again, so I accepted. \nIt seems like they are new and working out the kinks, but they've been there a year from what the server told me.

I read the reviews before hand and had a feeling of what to expect.\n\nFirst off parking, because it is a Sunday and the place is not busy you can park anywhere but if you did not know then you would be confused with the signs saying \"hotel guests only, register your vehicle in front desk\". I drove around looking for the restaurant parking but there is none. \n\nWe walked in and yes it is a beautiful atrium (thus the name (the atrium restaurant). I asked for a table of 7 and the host asked if we had reservations, I said no because I did not know we needed one (the place was pretty much empty...?). He sat us down at the very edge of the place where I would call \"no man's land\". To me I thought we looked pretty ok for a brunch buffet at a hotel (Sundays best clothing, no jeans..). Maybe it's because we looked young which would be a very nice compliment. \n\nWhile waiting for the rest of our party we ordered a bottle of red wine and coffee. Our server was okay, she had our drink orders fast and correct but forgot about us during our meal. Our plates started to pile up and we only had about a couple of plates each through out the meal.\n\nOk first I went to the salad bar and was turned off by how the wilted leaves look. The tomato salad looked very very old so I wouldn't even touch the pasta salad. The fish looked unwell. ..\n\nI went to the cooked side and had the veggies, cabbage rolls and bass fish. Then at the corner of my eye I saw coleslaw so I nab that fast  (I need some raw veggies).\n\nI sat and started on the cabbage roll. Hmm mm. ... It tastes like nothing with dull warm tomato sauce. The basa fish was over cooked and tasted like nothing as well. I think they may have tried to season it because they had seasoning and pieces of mandarins on top but still I found no pronounce taste.\nColeslaw was ok, it tastes like coleslaw but not overly mayo ed up.\n\nI needed to feel like this place has to have something I like so I went back (not like my partner who only had bacon and a bit of hashbrowns). I saw the seafood with crab legs, mussels, clams, and shrimp so I tried one of everything. I saw they had an omelette station and an eggs benedict so I definitely had one of those for sure.\n\nWent back to try it all and was strangely disappointed, I wanted to like something but the seafood tasted old and seemed like it was defrosted yesterday except for the shrimp that was still half frozen. The eggs benedict was hard and over cooked and the hollandaise sauce was just not good.\n\nI went back for dessert and tried the apple pie in a cup, a velvet cup cake, and a caramel tart bar. I took a bite of everything and no just no. I don't understand why I just did not like anything.\n I'm so sorry but I had Sunday brunch before at another place and I was so happy at the freshness of the food and this place was just not there.\n\nI read the reviews and I guess it may be a hit or miss place but I tried it and I'm not coming back. For the price you pay you can have a good meal else where.\n\nI'm giving 3 stars because I felt the server was nice and she tried to accommodate us as best she could. She came when our beverages where empty and filled our coffee.\n\nI'm sorry I am not coming back because the only part of my meal I enjoyed was the wine and the coleslaw. That you can get anywhere else and would probably be better (and not over priced). \nJust my honest opinion.","date":"2015-01-11 23:42:30","vector":[0.1643586207,0.2263,0.3612,0.0446555556,0.8625]}

The intent here was to take the extras back for an on the road lunch tomorrow. The crust couldn't have been from fresh dough and it seemed like it came out of a package. It was thin and not crispy. The toppings were ok but a bit sparse. Sauce? It definitely needed more sauce with some taste. The overall taste experience? Well with the thin crust and the sparse tasteless sauce it was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nAlso ordered a caesar salad comprised of chopped romaine tossed with a ceasar dressing from Costco topped with croutons and dry parmesan cheese out of one of those green containers. One can't mess up a salad but dry parmesan rather than grated fresh parmesan is a bit of a stretch.\n\nThey also served two thick slices of buttered (possibly with garlic salt) along with the meal.

You can do Korean BBQ or order regular entrees here so that offers some variety. Also, this is a fusion restaurant and from what I can tell so far, it's mainly a mix of Korean and Japanese. \n\nI'll have to say that the restaurant is pricey, but the service and portion size makes it pretty worth it. In my opinion, I think a dish would be able to feed two people so it's really not all that expensive. \n\nBe aware of the level of spicyness of the dishes, I would say it's a little above average. And they don't give levels of spicyness like other restaurants I've been too.

We went here starving!We left bloated because we ate too much LOL hot food excellent fish my goodness!and plentiful array of different and beautiful Asian offerings.\nGreat China buffet is a great Chinese buffet! You can definitely get your self nicely for here with excellent and healthy options.\n\nA little tip for you when you're using a buffet style restaurant. Go when the place is the busiest, like right at 5 o'clock for example. Everything will be \"ultra fresh\" and yummy beyond words because they're expecting a rush to come through those doors! I grew up working in food service. So,I understand the way a buffet would be run. For them, They expect a rush at dinnertime so at 5 o'clock or even 4 o'clock you would be the first in line for the freshest food that they could provide you! By using this method, you're always absolutely gonna love the bountiful offerings at this buffet\nAlso, if you don't like where you're seated, move! It's your dollar! Sit wherever you like. And have a great time. We sure did my wife the (fabulously beautiful Anna), was overjoyed with her food also so it wasn't just me. We recommend it 100%! Hit them around four or 5 o'clock and grab some of the freshest fabulous Asian food you can't get in for hit them around four or 5 o'clock and grab some of the freshest fabulous Asian food you can get!\nJust make sure you really able to drive home with a belly full of food. Happy face five stars excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent and excellent!","date":"2018-06-12 16:00:17","vector":[0.5029,0.0,0.0,0.1998,0.0]}

We spent a bit more than the amount of the coupon and were told that, because we used the Living Social deal, they would only accept cash for the remainder. Huh? The woman who took our order wouldn't explain why, only saying \"It's on the coupon\" - uh, no, it's not. I asked if she would make an exception, as I am nine months pregnant and the closest ATM is across a very large parking lot. It was 100 degrees out. Too bad. \n\nSo I trudged across the parking lot in the heat to get the cash. Had I not already paid for the Living Social deal, I would have simply left. I got back, paid for the food and we waited. When the food arrived, it was truly awful. This caliber of food is something I would eat at a friend's house to be polite. To charge money for it is arrogant, at best. \n\nWhen I asked to speak with the manager to inquire about why an exception couldn't be made to simply take a debit card (which they normally take, except from those who bought the Living Social deal), I was told no manager was on the premises. A few minutes later, I saw the owner herself behind the counter.

It's a normal portion. I only had the everything and the plain, both were great.\n\nOverall, good stuff, their staff and veggie options are definitely a plus!

They are highly unethical in their business dealings. A friend and I went in to purchase a polarizing filter and the salesman would only show us one brand even after I repeatedly asked him to show us all the options he had. He kept repeating that he had others, but the one he was showing us was the best one. From working at a camera shop in the past I know that the rep gets a kickback from certain vendors for every item sold. So the incentive is to only sell the brand you will get $$ for.  I ended up walking out because the guy was so annoying and felt for a $50 filter it wasn't worth the hassle. Meanwhile the salesman talked my friend into purchasing a add-on wide angle filter that was virtually worthless. The salesman showed him a link on Amazon showing the selling price as $2200. They said they could sell it to him for $800 because they had a special going and only had a few of the items left. When he said the price was too steep another guy came over with a calculator and said they would drop the price to $375.00. When he came out and showed me what he had bought I was very suspicious since I had never seen them sold in the camera store I worked in and I also couldn't understand technically how the filter would give him more stops on his lens. \n\nThe next morning I began researching the product and couldn't find anything on the company. no website, B&H didn't even sell anything of their products, no reviews on DP Review, nothing but that one Amazon link showing the product worth $2200. \n\nI called my former colleague at the camera store and he was able to determine the link on Amazon was a fake. Someone posted so people would think the product was worth more. I'm not sure who posted it but I wouldn't put it past New York Camera to have made the link themselves since that was his \"go to\" sales pitch.\n\nWe went back to the store the following morning to return the product. My friend hadn't even used it, box intact, with receipt showing he bought it the prior day. The sales person immediately told us they have a \"NO REFUNDS\" return policy. But he'd be happy to give us a store credit! We said it wasn't even used but he wasn't budging. I asked to speak to the manager. He told us the manager wasn't there. I told him to call the manager. He said, he wasn't available - he was driving. I said, \"call him on his cellphone\". He said, we should come back tomorrow when the manager would be available. I said, no, we're here now and we want a refund, not store credit. \n\nHe wanted to know why we were returning it - I said, \"because it's not worth the money you charged\". He wanted to know how I knew that. I said, Because I used to work at a camera store and my colleagues did some research this morning and we know that the site you showed my friend is a scam and if you don't give us a refund we will be making some phone calls. \n\nIt was then that the salesperson we had the prior day came swooping out of the back room. He said, \"Oh, we'll be able to give you your money back since you're not happy\". Not only did he refund the entire sale which included a filter we weren't returning, he also dropped the price on the filter $20. \n\nDo not purchase anything from this place.

We came in here during December right before I moved away and its adorable! It was the first bar we came back to at nighttime upon my return to visit New Orleans.  Per the name, its decorated as an old library...its a members only cigar bar, with plenty of tables and cozy chairs, with an extremely cozy feeling.  There's a piano which occasionally they play, and the bartender is one of the best i've encountered in NOLA!  The muddled berry vodka drink (not sure the name, he just whipped it up for us per saying i liked strong drinks and vodka) was amazing! They also had free champagne for a champagne tasting (always a good sign in my book as i loveee champagne!)\nThe clientele is obviously slightly older than your typical nola bar, and its a much dressier place to go than 99.99999% of the NOLA drinking scene.  Its on canal, so easy to walk to the quarter from, and the courtyard outside the Library Bar is really pretty too (and had an amazing christmas tree in december!)\nA great place to go if you want a classier, more low key establishment to avoid the crazy mardi gras\/bourbon crowds drunkenly spilling beer all over your cocktail dress\/sexually harassing you!","date":"2009-02-14 17:25:03","vector":[0.6842333333,0.7436,0.0,0.2243846154,0.0]}

He didn't like it at all and barely touched it. It was soggy and not flavorful. I had the Moules Mariniere - steamed mussels with white wine sauce, served with French fries. They were pretty good, but not phenomenal, and there wasn't a ton of food for the $13 that they cost. \n\nOverall, pretty meh experience. The service was average too - granted, we arrived shortly before they were closing, but with how few people were in the place our server should have been much more attentive to us.

I had one serving of 10 at the start of the game -- hot garlic -- and became full because of how thick the breading was. I asked for a side of ranch when ordering, but I never received it. I like my ranch dressing, especially if I'm eating chunks of breading. \n\nTo wash the \"wings\" down, I decided to take advantage of the 99 cent per 10-ounce mug of Bull Brew draft beer, which wasn't anything special but pretty good for a cheap and local beer (USF). \n\nThe service at the bar started out fine. I was asked multiple times if I wanted to order another plate of wings or if I needed another beer. Two hours went by, and when I was finally ready to take advantage of my all-you-can-eat deal, the bartenders were no where to be found. They all seemed busy trying to clean and close -- even though it was still early -- rather than serving their customers. \n\nAfter 10 minutes of waiting - and almost missing the 11 p.m. cutoff deadline for the wing deal - I finally got the attention of a bus person and ordered a serving of the honey garlic wings. Instead of getting the serving of 10 I received before, I got six. It could be because I was fuming at how bad of a beating the Gators were getting from the Louisville Cardinals, but my wings were barely warm. And yet again, they forgot to add my side of ranch I made sure to order. \n\nMaybe I ordered them too late? Or maybe I waited too long to get service? \n\nEither way, I wasn't thrilled about finishing my second serving of wings. \n\nAt this point I couldn't take it anymore -- the game or the wings -- so I asked for my check. Luckily my beers were cheap, so my bill added up to exactly $20 including tip ($11.99 for the all-you-can-eat wings plus the 99 cent beers). Not a bad price to pay to sit at the bar for almost three hours. \n\nMy experience could have been much better, though. Even if the Gators won. \n\nIf you're going to offer all-you-can-eat wings, do it the right way.","date":"2013-01-03 05:58:49","vector":[0.059675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

A large off-street parking lot in front of the building provides ample convenient parking. It was my first visit.\n\nThe interior matched the exterior, being a single unimaginative medium size dining room with a bar in the center. The south end of the area is sequestered behind a chest high wall to accommodate parents with children. There is a pool table in the north end of the area and TVs throughout, especially at the bar. The TVs were all tuned to sports with the audio muted. There was unrelated background music playing at an unobtrusive level.\n\nThere was only one staff member on duty greeting customers, tending bar, waiting tables, and otherwise working front of house when I arrived; however this was not a problem in that there were only six other customers in the place--two at a table and four at the bar. The one staff member acknowledged me promptly and quickly brought me a drink and a menu, but in a curiously deadpan manner. Inversely, it happened that I was there over shift change and the incoming staff member was friendly and engaging but somewhat inattentive.\n\nThey have a full bar and an extensive list of beers. The food menu is limited and perhaps rather heavy on cheese. Since I'm a fan of cheese, I don't see that as a problem. The menu does include a selection of appetizers, sandwiches, salads, pizzas and calzones, all at wonderfully low prices. I ordered the Breaded Mushrooms and the Chili Cheese Nachos. Both were delicious. The breading on the mushrooms was crisp and the mushrooms themselves were flavorful and not at all watery, giving evidence that they had never been frozen. The chili-cheese-tomato-onion-olive-jalape\u00f1o topping on the nachos was tasty and plentiful.\n\nWhile the decor has little to offer, the food alone makes Stout House a worthwhile reason to visit the north side.","date":"2017-08-12 03:14:29","vector":[0.0475153846,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

I'm here if you have anything to tell me\" right after she got in my friends face. Obviously that did not end well.

First, he stated it was the water from the lettuce...well, no there is a significant difference between a glaze of thick grease and water, so I showed him my Daughter's Nachos which did not have lettuce - tilted the plate and grease dripped to the table...Manger then stated it is the cheese, then stated it was the oil they cook with - What!  I just looked at him and he replied that my meal would be taken off of our bill and offered another plate, but I kindly rejected his offer.

It was a very pleasant experience.  The food is excellent, my wife had the small filet and I had the New York strip, we also had two sides.  The steaks were made to perfection, the sides were good.  The service was very nice and the manager came by our table on a couple of different occasions to check on us as well.  The atmosphere was very nice as well, the piano being played in the background made a very elegant experience.  I usually at this point try to say something that may not have been excellent or even poorly executed but I can not think of anything.  If we lived in Indy we would probably make Mo's a mainstay of our dining out budget as the price was also very reasonable.  I wholeheartedly suggest Mo's for your dining experience.\n  Ha, I just read the other reviews and found something that I can complain about, they stated that the napkins were awesome because they were starched and finely folded, I actually thought they were too heavily starched, it was actually a little rough to my lips as I wiped the juicy steak remains away from my mouth.  For the person who gave them two stars because they thought there were not any amazing flavors, I just have this to say, REALLY??  You really have no IDEA what a great American steak experience is about.  The meat speaks for itself.  You must be a millennial who expects Jesus to come down from the cross and personally welcome you every time you go to church or else you just are offended and think that the church experience was lacking. REALLY!!  For the National Guard gentleman who complained that the meal was too expensive compared to St. Elmo's and Fago Brazilian steakhouse all that I can say is that you are really a piece of work.  So on our dime you ate a 180 dollar meal that included three glasses of wine and steak and scallops, and I assume the steak must have been Kobe meat at the minimum because my wife and I actually paid the same thing and had four drinks between us.  Next time you go out on the government's dime I hope that Donald Trump is your commander in chief and he personally reviews your expense report.","date":"2016-07-30 22:36:52","vector":[0.2557333333,0.0065333333,0.0,0.3608125,0.0]}

The staff was excellent, the food was very flavorful, and the atmosphere is elegant and cozy with the fireplace and piano man. The men's bathrooms even have cologne and the women's restroom was stocked with a basket of hygiene products! \n\nThey give complimentary bread with butter, and the Asiago bread was delicious!\nI ordered the Classic Wedge salad, and everyone was right. This is really good (and quite filling for me). It was $9.\nMy husband ordered the 8 oz Prime Filet steak and said it was good, but not $50 kind of good. The Mac and Cheese side was enough for two people to split, and they used pepper jack cheese which was also tasty. \nThe lobster bisque soup that came with the steak was fantastic! \n\nOur friends ordered other types of steak and mentioned that it was the best steak they've had in a while. One ordered a Caesar salad (a small bowl that didn't look like much) and lobster Mac and cheese, but she was disappointed because it probably had sat in the kitchen for a while (there wasn't much cheese or it had dried). \n\nThey did a great job keeping waters refilled. I had a  good Manhattan, but I'm surprised that the bartender  left all the small ice cubes in the glass (because it watered down my drink). Rye Manhattan: $13.\n\nThe biggest problem we crossed: getting the checks at the end. We had a party of eleven people (approx $500)... And the waiter couldn't split our checks! So he gave us one bill and we all sat there figuring out what our totals were (and gratuity was already included in the total). It seems simple enough, but the couple who we were celebrating were fuming because the waiter came back and said that $55 was still owed after collecting everyone's money... So they paid the rest and our waiter disappeared for the rest of the evening. I don't think he helped very well with making sure things were split appropriately.\n\nThis was such a frustrating and awkward way to end the evening. Splitting checks and allowing folks to see their totals and gratuity and pay separately would've been much smoother.\n\nSuggestion: bring cash and ask to see the physical receipt & a pen so you can circle your meal and total. I should have taken the receipt book and done it myself for our table.\n\n(1 week after dining at Mo's: my husband and I just noticed that Mo's A Place For Steaks charged our checking account for $322.

Dinner Lab started in New Orleans and now also operates in Austin and Nashville. What they do: Take talented local chefs that don't have the opportunity to cook the food they love in the restaurant at which they work, and give them a venue to cook their dream meal. Each dinner is done pop-up style. The locations vary and are usually very unconventional (think empty warehouse). The chef cooks a five-course meal paired with drinks, while guests sit at long tables, make new friends and eat to their heart's content. \n\nI chose to attend the Puerto Rican dinner cooked by talented chef Francisco \"Paco\" Robert. 24 hours before the event we got an email with a link to the address of the dinner. We pulled up to a warehouse space off of 4th Ave South and walked through a maze of open studs to find a beautiful setup.\n\nDinner Lab really knows how to fancy up an empty space! We arrived at 7 and were welcomed with cocktails. They had a nicely stocked bar, with a talented bartender ready to mix things up to your liking. I went with one of the house drinks which was a sweet tropical punch with a starfruit as garnish. Fancy pants!\n\nOur first course was Bunuelos de Bacalo, which are cod fritters. The fritter was served with pickled squash and a lime-crema. This reminded me of Jamaican fish cakes, which I love. It had just the right amount of fishy flavor that was cut nicely with the lime-crema. The drink pairing was a passion fruit mojito which was added some complimentary sweetness to the saltiness of the cod.\n\nOur second dish was a bean stew with pig tails. If you have been reading my blog for a while, you know I like all the parts of the pig that most people turn away from, so seeing this on the menu made me happy. I loved the flavor of the pig tails. They were cooked until they were fall-off-the-bone tender and with the beans made a really thick hearty stew. It was paired with a Yazoo Hefeweizen (a beer that is normally too \"banana-y\" for me) but I thought this pairing was genius. The light fruitiness of the beer really cut the thick fattiness of the stew.\n\nNext up was ceviche on roasted eggplant with corn salsa and almonds. I have to be honest- this was the only dish that I thought fell short. The eggplant was overcooked and was pretty soggy and if you add tender and soft ceviche to it, you get an overly mushy plate. I feel like the fish would have been better showcased on a eggplant chip or crusty bread. The upside was the corn and almonds were a really nice addition and added a tad bit of much needed crunch. The ceviche was paired with a white Spanish wine that I enjoyed, considering I'm mostly a red wine gal.\n\nAlright people, hold on to your panties, here is the Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of this meal: Lengua a la Fricasse. This dish is braised beef tongue with a pumpkin mash, an onion raisin slaw and some fried pig fat cracklings. I could hardly contain my excitement over this dish! The tongue was perfect, cooked so long and low that the meat just melted in your mouth. And to Chef Paco's credit, the tongue retained amazing flavor and didn't have the curse of being bland. The pumpkin mash and the onion raisin slaw added a really nice sweet note to the fatty tongue. And who can say no to FRIED FAT?! Everything about this dish was beautiful and I will probably try to recreate this in my kitchen sometime soon when I'm feeling brave. The Lengua was paired with a Spanish red wine.\n\nLet's talk dessert, because this meal ended on a high note. It's hard to find a well-rounded chef that can also make a really stand out sweet dish (hello every season of Top Chef- I'm looking at you) and Paco had this DOWN. Dessert was Tembleque a Coconut Flan served with dulce de leche, spiked peaches and ajonjoli (candied sesame seeds). I have a soft spot for flan and this was made slightly different, using starch instead of egg as a binder. The consistency was smooth and cool and was cut with the rum of the peach. I will admit that I made sure to pick up all the caramel from the plate with my finger. I HAVE NO FOOD SHAME. The drink that was paired with this was like a Puerto Rican version of egg nog, but fancier and way better than any egg nog I've ever had. It was thick and sweet (condensed milk FTW) and I even went back to beg the bartender for seconds. \n\nOverall, I was totally impressed with this dinner and everything Dinner Lab is trying to do. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the polite and attentive waitstaff and the fact that everyone made a pointed effort to make guests comfortable, happy, and encourage mingling.","date":"2013-07-26 15:57:51","vector":[0.21092,0.35232,0.0,0.2003266667,0.0]}

Which medieval muslims were being channeled that night?  African, Middle Eastern, East or South Asian or South East Asian.  Mali? Senegal?  \n\nThis was the most disappointing Dinner Lab experience this year, leading us to not renew.\n\nThe Chef has had moderate success in Nashville, but these offerings weren't well-informed or well-executed.  The starter was a salted white fish--bacalao?  Too salty.  If bacalao, it needed a lot more prep and soaking.  Where was the explanation?  The context setting?  \n\nThe starter cocktail boasted date.  So disappointing.  Muddy alcohol; where was the date?\n\nThe charred sardine was the highlight of the meal--tasty, but not spectacular.  \n\nThe lentils were underdone and hard and bland.  \n\nThe main entree was lamb chops.  Rare, which was fine, but cooled by the time it reached me and as a result seemed fatty, low quality, and pretentiously served. \n\nThe dessert was bread pudding--fig being the only nod to the Middle East, if indeed those were the Muslims the chef was channeling....\n\nBottom line:  I don't know the chef, but my observation is that this dinner lab was mostly hype and when the chef said he was inspired to cook this meal after reading a cookbook, I felt deflated.  I was soured by the experience.  This was not an inexperienced crowd of untraveled locals who would suspend their disbelief and follow the chef into a hookah cloud of delusion.\n\nStill nursing my sourness.","date":"2014-08-16 22:45:21","vector":[0.1231538462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Coming from Houston, Vietnamese food is something I eat often and usually plan my day around finding the good stuff, and I've been struggling to find something comparable in Nashville. I am happy to have found that in Banh Mi & Roll Factory. \n\nServing up some cult classics, these guys know how to make a good banh mi. If you know anything about Banh Mis, you know it's all about the bread. The Baguette is exactly what you want - fluffy on the inside with a crunch on the outside. For filling, I chose to go with pork and I wasn't disappointed (can anyone ever be with pork though?). They also offered chicken, pate, and tofu, so options were plentiful. The daikon slaw was delicious, the pickle they used was tangy and sweet in a way that complimented rather than combated the savory meat. The one thing I could have asked for though was a little more jalape\u00f1o. I like mine Banh Mis with a little spice! \n\nMy friends got their vermicelli and loved their bowls. Hefty size for a food truck, so the time and money spent was paid off well. They also tried the spring rolls and the only thing I can say there is they were eaten in a flash, before I could ask if they liked them. My assumption was yes. Most of them got the Vietnamese iced coffee, which they seemed to enjoy.\n\nI myself got their soda Chanh which was delicious!! I cannot express how much I loved this!!! It tasted like freshly made lemonade, with the perfect balance of sweet with a hint of sour. Pro tip: stir it before you drink it or else you'll get all the sour in one gulp.

This is served with a side of sliced baguette but I asked for vermicelli noodles instead which was a good complement. The curry is a yellow coconut milk broth with potatoes, carrots and onion and topped with large basil leaves and a sprinkle of green onion. The chicken in the curry was cooked well and the pieces were actually pretty big. I got a Thai iced tea to drink which is one of my favorite drinks on the planet and theirs is great. Next time I'd love to try one of their bahn mi sandwiches or their fresh rolls. The ingredients in my curry were all fresh and the flavor was great. \n\nService was very fast and the guy at the window was nice. The wait at some food trucks can be very long so I was appreciative that they put everything together quickly. As food truck experiences go this is tops! I recommend checking them out when you see them around town!","date":"2017-11-14 20:37:24","vector":[0.1751238095,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

The sushi was surprisingly pretty fresh. \n\nThe place looked pretty modern and trendy. Photos of mirth and good times captured forever plastered to the wall as soon as you walk in is always a crowd pleaser. \n\nThe location seems kind of out of the way, but the place was full of daily grinders on lunch break, so that was another good sign. \n\nIt was also good to see the owners (or someone there) had a sense of humor because posted on a placard by the bar was an ad for a special \"SB 1070\" roll. Whoever came up with that clearly didn't understand the cultural complexity of such a thing as the ingredients didn't make sense, if they were trying to be funny with it. Someone with a dark, sardonic, sarcastic sense of humor (such as myself) would have made that thing with refried beans, jalapenos, and crusted with crushed tortilla chips. HAHA. \n\nMy only complaint is that when we were seated and the server came, they seemed to have the stereotypical Asian \"hurry up and buy\" vibe going on. The lady spoke very fast, making it seem like they wanted to feed us, then kick us out. Well unbeknownst to her, I was \"on duty\" and where I work, I don't get to go to any real city often at all so I wasn't going to be pressured even if I were playing Russian roulette while reading the menu. \n\nWe ordered and shortly after we all had complimentary miso soup, a standard thing for sushi restaurants but it was nice to see they are on that page as well. Not long after that, all our meals came out. Expeditiousness really is their goal. \n\nThe items are a bit pricey but that isn't usually a complaint of mine, not because I'm a big shot but because I enjoyed my meal and I had a good time. \n\nIf you're nearby, Fusion Wasabi is worthy of checking out.","date":"2012-02-21 00:52:12","vector":[0.1734555556,0.0,0.0,0.1646333333,0.0]}

I had ordered a large rice, not realizing that it was only the two of us & that was way too much, so I changed my mind & ordered something else.

So I ate my food, because I was starved by then. After I had finished I threw away a whole plate of untouched rice from my son.

In a sea of generic chain restaurants, Rachel's stands out as an old fashioned, family-owned place. It's a deli, nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, and it's good at being deli. \n\nThe service here is super quick. You'll grab your food, grab a drink, and pay all within five minutes, even during the lunchtime rush. And while you wait: indulge in the free pickles, they're pretty good!\n\nMy favorite sandwich here is the corned beef on rye with spicy brown mustard. They pile on a lot of corned beef, and hold it in place with an olive crowned toothpick. It's a classic, and it makes me happy just to think of it. For what you get, the prices at Rachael's are pretty competitive. You can get  a good sandwich, chips and a drink for eight bucks.\n\nI highly recommend giving Rachael's corned beef sandwich a whirl next time you're in center city.","date":"2009-10-15 03:26:58","vector":[0.2876777778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

But this experience was so maddening, I absolutely had to write about it. \n\nWe are in the middle of a pandemic and I happen to be 8 months pregnant. After a stressful work Monday, I decided to treat myself and my husband who just had dental work done to some smoothies and a hummus bowl. Normally my husband does all the outside errands for us but when I saw that Tropical Smoothie Cafe was offering curbside, I offered to go. I placed my order online and received confirmation that it would be ready by 7:56. Since I would just be doing curbsde, I brought my pup along for the ride. \n\nI arrived to the Cafe at 8:00 and parked directly in front of their curbside sign outside the entrance door. The sign had a number on it, which I called, but no one answered. So I waited. A number of people were inside waiting in line. I figured they might be slammed so I waited. 8:15 rolls around and I try to give another call. Again, no one answers. At this point everyone who was in line waiting has received their orders and left and more people have arrived. \n\nAt 8:15, I decide to pop inside just to make sure they had my order and I was ok to wait outside in the car with my dog. They told me yep, I was to just wait in my car. \n\nAt 8:30, when the line had now cleared, I go back inside and stand in front of the register. NO ONE SPOKE TO ME FOR TEN MINUTES. I was not acknowledged at all. It was at this time I got to take note of the absolute soaking countertops that made me question whether I really wanted to have anything from here at all... When an employee finally approached me, the same one from earlier who told me to wait in my car, he confirmed I had a to go order... then I watched him PULL IT OUT FROM THEIR MINI FRIDGE. It was already made. How long was it in there?? Why had no one brought it out to me?? Why was I ignored for ten minutes while they prepared other people's orders?? To top it all off, I am 8 months pregnant in a pandemic trying to avoid all contact with people AND my dog was in the car! \n\nI got back in my car at 8:45 absolutely infuriated at this entire experience.

Yesterday was no exception. We decided to go for brunch at Le Bus in Manayunk, but there was a wait, so I suggested we check out Bourbon Blue instead.\n\nThe place was empty alright, but that suited us fine. Thankfully, it was warm inside, but a little drafty near the windows. We loved the decor of the restaurant.\n\nWe both decided to go with the Crabcake Benedict. I also ordered tea, and was surprised to find out that they didn't offer herbal tea. MOST of the brunch spots we go to do have a nice selection of teas. I went with plain old Lipton tea, and my bf had coffee.\n\nWhen our food came, it looked delicious. After the first bite, we discovered it WAS delicious, however it was ICE COLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  On a cold day, the last thing I want to eat is cold eggs.  I called the waitress over, and asked if our food could be warmed up. She told me,\"Unfortunately, we don't have a microwave, so we would have to make the whole entree over again.\"  Seriously?? What restaurant in this day and age doesn't have a microwave?\n\n\nWe toyed with the idea for a minute as she went to find a manager, and decided we didn't really want to wait another 20 minutes for our order.  The waitress returned a minute later without a manager, but said they would make the order over. We told her not to bother, and ate the ice cold meal anyway. We also ordered a pumpkin pancake which was also very good, but again.... COLD.\n\nFor the life of me, I can't figure out how our food had a chance to get cold when there was only 2 other tables of guests in the place.   Very disappointing.  Too bad... because if it was warm, that would have been one of the best Crabcake Benedicts I have ever had.  The hollandaise sauce was just right, and my eggs were cooked to perfection. The potatoes were delicious, and my pancake was fantastic, in spite of its iciness.\n\nOverall, we decided we like Bourbon Blue, but we won't go there again on a cold day. I won't do cold eggs again, sorry! By the way, I would have given Bourbon Blue a 4, possibly a 5, if my food was even a tad bit warm.","date":"2011-10-30 13:34:10","vector":[0.2692117647,0.0903,0.0,0.2193428571,0.0]}

So this review is from my experience over the span of a year & some change. The service is usually pretty bad, some times to the point where we say we wouldn't go back. But living in Manayunk leaves your options pretty slim. The bartenders are mostly awful. The red head is always miserable looking. And guy who is usually bartending with her is really bad. He will ignore you trying to get his attention while he holds conversations with other customers. Also, he will very obviously grab or slap the red head bartender's ass right in front of everyone. And since she never smiles I can't tell if she's happy about it or not. But it's incredibly unprofessional and frankly, sexual harassment. So, he's a creep. Now onto the food- it's ok. It's overpriced. They have two vegan options: a salad, or sweet potatoe fries. (Insert the emoticon of me shooting myself). Last night when I was there, they were out of veggie burgers. Awesome. When I was just vegetarian and not vegan, there were obviously a few more options, but not much. And risotto for $18?! And that's without adding any of the protein up charges. My boyfriend eats meat so he can order anything. He loves the filet tip sandwich and a couple other things. Overall, I don't enjoy going here simply because, just like the rest of Manayunk (for the exception of Couch Tomato & Taqueria), there are awful options for people who don't eat meat!

When we arrived at our room at the exact check in time of 3:00pm, we found it had not been cleaned yet from the previous renters.  Upon calling the number on the office door, I was greeted with a very helpful and apologetic lady on the other end of the phone.  I was told the cleaning crew would be called and I would be updated on exactly when we could get in the room.  I received both phone calls and text messages letting me know what was going on during this process.  It was 3 hours later when I received the final text letting me know the room was now ready for us (not a real big deal since you can definitely find something to do in Nashville for 3 hours!). Within a few minutes I also received a phone call apologizing again for the inconvenience along with a partial refund for my booking.  WOW!  This was very refreshing to know a company felt we were valued enough to compensate us for a miscommunication on their end with the cleaning crew...... (without me even asking for any type of refund!).  Oversights can happen to anyone but, the way this handled on their part was very impressive and greatly appreciated.  \n\nAlso, we were happy to see the room was spotless and smelled very clean when we returned.  We stayed 3 nights and will absolutely be coming back to McMillian Court for our next trip to Nashville!!

I honestly only went there once for dinner, but the pizza was great! I would go in to pick up a pizza every few months. The place was very dark and dated. The clients were older. I would grab my pizza to go and take it somewhere less depressing to eat.\n\nBut, news spread on Facebook that the Pink Gorilla was taking over Park Allen's space. The Pink Gorilla? We soon figured out that the Pink Gorilla was product of the Local Omnivore creators. The Local Omnivore is a favourite of my friends and I. Now I was more excited than sad! \n\nThe Pink Gorilla opened this weekend. We went for Sunday lunch. We were greeted by a newly renovated space and a friendly staff. The walls are white and the restaurant feels more vibrant. The menu offers pizza and calzones. \n\nIt was a bit early to try the craft beers, but we opted for two pizzas. I ordered the pink gorilla and my friend a triple pepperoni. They each came with a choice of sauce. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty quiet. Only a few tables occupied. The staff kept refilling our water glasses and coming to chat. The chef came out and greeted each customer when he had the chance. \n\nOur pizzas arrived and were very flavourful. I actually liked the mustard on my pizza. Weird, but good. My friend was impressed with her pepperoni.\nThe pies are a good size for one, cut Isquares and loaded with toppings. The crust is crispy, and just the right thickness.\n\nThere is a discount for take-out pizza. So, I probably will take advantage of that at some point. But, I really like the new inviting and friendly vibe of the restaurant. So, I'll return for both take-out and dine-in. Can't wait to introduce friends to the Pink Gorilla! \n\nWe've been back!

However, we were pleasantly surprised to see not one but TWO vegan pizzas on the menu. \n\nWe ended up grabbing a couple craft beer cans and the Curried Crispy Chickpea pizza. O.M.G! I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the best vegan pizza I've ever had (and I've had A LOT of vegan pizza). We had ordered a large assuming there would be leftovers for lunch and ended up devouring the whole thing. My only issue is that while I like the look of cutting the pizza into squares, this particular pizza was very messy. By the end of the meal my hands were covered in garlic oil and the tahini maple sauce.\n\nBased on food alone, I would give Pink Gorilla a solid 5 stars. I can't wait to come back and try their other vegan option. However, I am going to lower it to 4 for now as the atmosphere is severely lacking. There are a couple cool touches like the use of church pews for benches but the stark, blank, white walls paired with neon lighting has an odd effect.

I couldn't give him higher reviews!\n\nHe was outstanding from start to finish. He was very easy to get in touch with and was quick to respond. He worked with us on what we would like to cook, taking the time to inquire on any dietary restrictions, and offering up possibilities. We settled on a fairly traditional New Orleans type fare with a gumbo, blackened red fish, and espresso beignets. \n\nWe paid for a three hour cooking lesson, but Brandon went above and beyond coming early for setup and staying over an hour after answering questions and ensuring everything was cleaned up. He was very personable and knowledgeable on everything he was cooking and even prepared personalized handouts with the menu, recipes, etc. He was very professional and did a great job of instructing us and then taking over when we wanted to eat. \n\nAs for the food, I couldn't give it higher reviews. Everything prepared was absolutely amazing. My whole family raved about how flavorful the grits were, how it was the best gumbo they've ever had, how the fish was perfectly cooked, etc. It may have been a bit too good since I took a nap as soon as the lesson was over! \n\nMy siblings and I enjoyed the lesson so much they made a special trip out to Brandon and his wife's popup restaurant, Splendid Pig a few days later just to enjoy some more of Brandon's cooking. They said everything was superb there as well (unfortunately I wasn't able to make this trip since I had overindulged a bit the night before in classic New Orleans fashion). \n\nI couldn't give Brandon a higher rating. The value was incredible, especially for the individualized attention. The food was delicious, and the overall experience was just what we had hoped for. I would highly recommend Brandon's lessons and a visit to the Splendid Pig next time you're in NOLA!","date":"2015-01-05 21:15:28","vector":[0.3312875,0.1953,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

This pop-up restaurant has been operating out of Carrolton Station on Monday nights since late November. The owners are a husband and wife duo and the husband is also one of the butchers at cleaver and Co. \n\nThis place is basically in a small plate format with portions suitable for sharing but probably not quite big enough for you to just order one entree and be full. The food is sort of new Cajun with a decidedly meat-centered menu. What was also surprising was that they had a full assortment of king cakes and pastries. The ambience is the same as the host bar with some candles on tables but not much more. Cutlery and dishwater are all disposable. You order at the host table and the food is brought out to you. Those elements aren't ideal, but for a 2 person operation washing dishes and formal table service can't be expected. Ok, now onto the food:\n\n1. Shrimp and andouille gumbo- awesome flavor with a little heat. Roux was perfect and the little popcorn rice \"cakes\" in there took the dish to another level.\n\n2. Spinach salad with olives, manchego, nuts- very nice salad but nothing earth shattering.\n\n3. Cornish hen with carrots and Brussel sprouts- this was the group favorite-\nThe glaze on the chicken was perfect! Only way to make it better would be to put a full hen in the dish instead of just a portion.\n\n4. Tuna, creme fraiche, oyster bread pudding- my second favorite - tuna seared on the outside but nice and raw in the middle. The oyster\/mushroom bread pudding was a little dry but unlike anything else I've ever had.\n\n5. Pork shank with mushroom ragout on pasta- delicious but didn't stand out on its own. Shank was nice any savory. \n\n6. Strawberry cream cheese king cake- this was delicious with fresh strawberries and super soft dough. The champagne icing was a nice touch but the tartness from cream cheese filling really made this stand out.\n\nOverall this was an awesome concept that has some really solid food. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the cuisine but I would recommend they either go smaller (meaning that we get into the $3-7\/plate range) or bigger ($10+) depending if they want to be more of a small plates place or more of a traditional dining environment. Some of the food elements remind of the Purple Pig in Chicago, IL which sort of keeps a similar small plates format paired with a solid and affortable wine list.

Smoke bellows from the chimney indicating that chicken is being grilled over an open flame. At first sight, it seems like a sibling to the El Pollo Loco chain, but El Pollo Feliz is unique in its own right.\n\nFrom the outside, the quasi square building resembles any run-of-the-mill fast-food restaurant, with windows all around, parking along most of the perimeter, and a drive-thru lane. Once inside, you order over the counter, then go to your table (you seat yourself), also arranged much like a fast-food joint: soda fountain, salsa bar. Nothing to brag home about. Our order was taken courteously and accurately. While the locale is kid-friendly, there aren't long tables, so large parties would have to split tables. The restrooms were adequate.\n\nThe chicken is what sets El Pollo Feliz apart from other fast-food sandwich places. The chicken, grilled over an open flame, is available in different portions. We ordered a whole chicken meal, which included our choice of corn or flour tortillas, as well as rice, beans, a house salad, and fresh salsa. Two roasted jalapeo peppers were also included. The chicken was flavorful and most pieces were moist. The breast piece was a bit on the dry side, as one might expect. The beans were wonderful, with a true \"homemade\" taste, not the pasty or gooey type. The salad (mostly iceberg lettuce) was crisp and fresh but felt like it could use another spin to get all the water out. (The good part is that we know it's been washed.) Desert-wise, there is a great flan available. The only drawback in our experience was the relatively long wait for the food.\n\nVerdict: Honest and tasty grub in a low-ley setting. A great value, if you're not in a hurry.","date":"2007-12-21 04:48:06","vector":[0.1631315789,0.0,0.0,0.0936916667,0.0]}

But overall, it still tasted pretty good (3.5 stars, in my book) and wasn't nearly as messy as it could've been considering there was a fried egg in it. It certainly wasn't the dense greaseball of a cheesesteak that Philly is often known for, but maybe that's a good thing. Coming in on a Wednesday was a stroke of luck as well, since I was able to get a free order of fries (which were delicious) to go along with my sandwich, totaling my meal at just under $10.

First off, the delivery driver showed up at the worst time or maybe it was the perfect time. Now this wasn't his fault. Unbeknownst to me there was an underground fire directly in front of my building. He informed me of what was going on and just as I peeked out the door I saw a cop yelling for everyone to evacuate. I quickly told the driver I'd have to call him back. Some 10 to 15 min later after I evacuated I called him, expecting that he had left by then. Nope! He waited it out across the street until I could get out if my apartment. He also texted me later to make sure everyone was safe. So nice of him!\n\nNow the food. I built my own sandwich. It needed a few more veggies (I'm vegetarian), the bread to veggie ratio was off, but otherwise it was fantastic. You have to love the option of getting crispy onions or fried pickles in your sandwich. They definitely don't skimp when it comes to the spreads\\sauces.

The bread was a hoagie-type that cheesesteaks are usually served in, but not super oily and all ingredients were fresh. Overall, the sandwich was filling, fresh and absolutely delicious. Only reason I took a star off is because 1) I was really hungry before I ate at Jake's -- and we know everything tastes better when you're hungry and 2) not sure if I would pay full price for the sub... which is why you should come on Monday or Tuesday when they have $5 pork cheesesteaks and BOGO chicken cheesesteaks, respectively.

We went during dinner. \n\nThe Food: \n\nStarter:\n\nThe Guacamole, guajillo salsa, and corn tostatadas.\n\nThis dish is your standard house guacamole,  albeit high quality to say the least; but what makes it a cut above is the guajillo salsa, which adds a nice smoky spicy contrast to the acidic creamy guacamole. \n\nTacos:\n\nWe only got one order, and that was my biggest regret.  The charred steak, queso, and tomatillo was great. All the flavors worked together really well.\n\nBotanas\n\nThis was really hit or miss.\n\nPumpkin Blossom quesadilla, ancho chile - This was probably the best cheesiest food that I had put into my mouth. It wasn't overbearing. It utilizes three different cheeses and incorporates them in different ways, which made what would be a traditional cheese quesadilla elevated.  The pumpkin blossoms and the ancho chile do a good job of cutting down the richness. A weird recommendation, but I enjoyed it.\n\nOctopus, Pork Belly, Poblano Rice, Aioli -  The octopus, pork belly, and fingerling potato are served on two skewers on a small bed of rice. Octopus is cooked well. The Pork Belly was tough and not seasoned like the octopus and potato. The rice was good though I wish there was more of that poblana flavor coming through. The dish itself is small, (hence Botanas) so if you are with company that really likes octopus, I would recommend ordering two. \n\nChile Relleno, Crawfish, Tomato Broth - This dish was probably the disappointment of the night. The pepper was stuffed with quinoa, which doesn't play off the texture and flavors of the pepper and the tomato broth. There is very little seasoning, whether it be salt or spice, in this dish. The crawfish choice also feels a little weird. If you are fan of Campbell's tomato soup, I would recommend it to you, but there are better options on the menu. \n\nDrinks:\n\nMezcalero- mescal, cava, ginger, and grapefruit bitters. \n\nIf you are a ginger fan get this. I loved it. It is a great cocktail especially for the summer.\n\nAgua Fresca, Tequila\/Vodka, Watermelon, Mint, and Serrano, \n\nAnother great all around drink. Wish there was a tad more Serrano to be a little more pronounced next to all that watermelon. \n\nLuchini - Ruby Port, Pineapple, Lemon.\n\nFeels like sangria. Not overly sweet. A decent drink.\n\nVerdict: Recommend \n\n I feel like they need to work on their Botanas; however, I am excited to go back soon and try their Brunch \n\nThis is a great place for dates and a nice hangout for friends during the week. I feel for a summer bite to eat,  I would recommend it. I would avoid most of the Botanas. Tacos and Drinks  I feel is what separate this place from others.","date":"2019-06-17 16:21:10","vector":[0.1560914894,-0.1531,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Not only was there no improvement, the food was worse.  Bread was damp and gummy, meatballs had too much bread and barely tasted like meat, sauce\/gravy was tasteless.  I am not going to go back.  I am really sad.\n\nPrevious review. \nI have been going to DiMeo's since it opened, sometimes 2x a week.  The food was fabulous, bread spectacular, and the pizza terrific.  But 2 weeks ago I had the worst meal there ever. The menu used to have a side of pasta and side of meatballs which I used to combine.  With a house salad, the meal was reasonably priced and lots to eat.  I used to get just meatballs and marinara sauce & keep them at home.  Neither sides are on the menu anymore but I asked and they made the dish so I got my favorite meal. \n\nThe salad dressing (balsamic vinaigrette) was way too strong and there was probably too much on the salad. I couldn't taste any of the ingredients other than the dressing. Thank goodness the bread was there to stop the burning.  There is nothing you can say about pasta, but the meatballs and sauce (gravy, depending on where you are from) are another story.  There was no taste to either. The meatballs tasted like mush with no spices or even distinguishing meat taste and the sauce was equally tasteless.  I even wonder if it was the marinara which used to be quite exciting there.  No spice, no pizzazz, no tomatoes\/onion\/anything bits.\n\nI am sure part of the problem is that the owners and original chefs are not there anymore.  I saw no one from the original family or anyone who used to work there.  \n\nI will go back, but with some trepidation and maybe I will stick to pizza.","date":"2015-10-08 17:47:25","vector":[0.1758,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

Let me tell you something -- this coffee shop has as much sex appeal as a porn store, but at the same time has a message which is to be open minded and be who you are.\n\nI find this place quite interesting. The location looks like a 'ready for demolition' building that has been vacant for some years when in true actuality, it is settled in the same building as Koken Art Factory. You park in a private lot on Sidney Street then you walk in to the side of the building directly across the street. From there, you ascend up some stairs and the door will open to this large open space where you are greeted with the sex crazed coffee shop.\n\nSome menu items you will find are 'The Poly' which is a 'build your own' sandwich to 'The Swinger' which is a combo meal. This place truly lacks for nothing when it comes to the menu items despite such risque names.\n\nI ordered a cup of Vegan Pho. I am not Vegan, but this is truly was a delightful light meal. The meal itself came will all items separated on a large plate. The broth itself is settled in a cup. The other ingredients included cilantro, spinach leaves, sweet soy sauce, bean sprouts, and spicy chili sauce. It costs $3.25 for a cup.\n\nEver rented porn? Well, you can from Shameless Grounds. They an ample amount of Penthouse Magazines and other similar leisure materials including pornographic movies\/dvds, and erotic novels. Ask them at the register about getting a \"library card\". You can also buy toys here too. You know, whips and stuff! Not the kind you'd give to your children either.\n\nThey're you have it.

The streets around the storefront don't seem super safe, and I would definitely not venture to this area unaccompanied or after-dark.  The entrance is a bit sketch as well.  When you enter from the street, you walk up a stairwell and have to enter another door to get in to the shameless venue.  Across the hall is a seemingly abandoned space with a random couch... Do squatters live here?\n\nThe Shameless Grounds is like no other coffee shop I have ever been to.  As others have mentioned, it is a sex positive coffee shop.  I had no idea what this meant, so I took to the website.  They have a library with ... well literature of a sexual nature.  It is basically just a safe haven for all.  You aren't quizzed about your sexual orientation upon entering, and you don't have to partake in the library if you don't wish to do so.  I didn't go in, but am curious to know what all is in there.  I am an inquisitive person by nature, so I'd love to see what I could learn.\n\nNow on to the tasty yummy portion of my review... I got the hot chocolate and at the last minute decided to have the lovely barista add praline syrup... Wha!?!  Praline in syrup form... I have never heard of this, nor have I had the privilege of trying such a wonderful addition.  I am picky about hot chocolate, and this one is just about the best I've ever had.  Honestly.  If you don't like sweet hot chocolate, this is not the one for you (I clearly do).  They use Ghiradelli chocolate, and I was definitely a fan.  I, unfortunately for me, didn't try any of the food offerings, but John D. had a pumpkin soup that looked amazing.  If I knew him better, I would have stolen a spoonful when he was turned in the other direction.\n\nFrom what I read on their website, there are seminars and forums to partake in, but I was there for a very important and serious reason.  I was there to paint a pumpkin... and boy, did I paint a pumpkin.  I am so glad that I decided to partake in this month's Yelp Office Hours.  I have already had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of several attendees, but I got to meet some new (to me) Yelpers that I've *interacted* with on the site, and it was great to physically meet them.\n\nEven though we must have looked like a bunch of little kids painting our baby punkins, we had a blast.

If I was fanciful, I would liken Shameless Grounds to some 18th century French courtesan hidden behind fancy lacy garters, a bright gem amongst a dreary dilapidated street. \n\nLike others have posted, it's in a strange part of town, a little off the beaten path of funky Benton Park. It's okay though because it adds to the atmosphere. There is plenty of street parking and they have an additional free parking lot across the street. I totally would have missed the entire place, save for the logo spotlighted off the building. (It also did help that I was on the website several hours before, checking it out). I think the idea of re-utilizing a warehouse for a coffeehouse is an awesome idea...we need more stuff like that in here in St. Louis!\n\nIt doesn't look like much when you first enter off the street. A barricade towards your right, stairs up your left. Midway up the stairs, you're faced with more stairs, an empty room on your right, and a spotlighted door on your left with the simple coffeehouse logo. But once you open that door, it's like an entirely different world. \n\nSuper cozy and ambient, it's a lot bigger than one would think. Lots of tables and sitting areas with free wi-fi; it's really a great setup. There is even a stage where the fun happens, including a drag show that John D. told me about, kinky karaoke, and kinky bingo. There is a complete calendar of events on their website. Subtly, they have their \"not for kids\" lending library in the back, complete with leather couches and computers. They also have a section of books for sale, which is a neat idea. \n\nI had a pumpkin latte, which was perfectly made. Not too dark, not too light. Drinks are anywhere from $3 to $5. I didn't get anything to eat, but the pumpkin soup smelled heavenly. I saw some sandwiches, and it looked to be a little on the smallish side, but I couldn't tell you anything about the taste. Meals should run you about $3 to $8.\n\nThe best is their Curbside Caffeine Mondays through Fridays. Set up an account with them (or pay cash), text them at 508-JOLT-2-GO, and they'll bring your order out to the curb.

Great flavors in a self serve setup, friendly and helpful staff, and a nice topping selection that includes my standards (dark chocolate chips, yogurt chips, and chopped almonds). So you can still go in and get the product you're after, but there's something about the experience that's a bit different. \n\nIt seems to be what this location doesn't have that makes it so different. It doesn't really have the same warmth and design of the other location, and it definitely doesn't have the customers sitting and enjoying their yogurt like the South Meadows location does either.\n\nNow, to be fair, I have never stayed at Yogurt Beach to enjoy my yogurt. For me it's something to be squirreled away to my den (house) and enjoyed on my couch with some TV in the background. But there's something nice about walking into a busy business, where you can actually see customers enjoying themselves. \n\nThis location is just drab. It's in a big open room shared with a restaurant which is never open from what I can tell. It does have some of the same design elements and branding, but it just doesn't feel the same. \n\nI'm not sure if this location will ever feel like the other one, so for now, whenever I'm asked, Hey!

Normally I go to this location as it's the closest to my house, but I think I might have to find a new establishment. The employees always seem to be nice, but they really aren't very accommodating. It seems like every time I go there they are out of one or more flavor, and the employees are pretty slow to refill them. Also, their fruit selection is awesome, when it's available, and once again it seems to be hard to keep it stocked, as they are out of at least one type of berry every time, and there isn't a sense of urgency to refill them. I will say that the employees have been very cordial and nice at this location, but just not very helpful. Frozen Yogurt has been stellar though, and I love the Cookie Dough and the hot fudge. Hopefully the upkeep on the flavors and the toppings can be improved, as this would significantly bring up the rating.","date":"2017-01-17 02:47:03","vector":[0.4912,0.4456333333,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

My husband and I were not able to keep our cake top because we were married in another city so I wanted one made to closely match the cake we had and surprise him with it on our anniversary.  My cake was a lemon cake with raspberry filling and had buttercream frosting.  \n\nI should've known that this would be a mistake when I got there and showed them a picture of my cake and described it to the that they weren't that skilled.  First she argued with me that my design was fondant when I knew it was all buttercream design and frosting.  She said she wouldn't be able to create the design and I said the taste\/flavor was way more important. \n\nI gave her the order and described my 'Raspberry Lemonade' cake to her.  She asked about the filling and proceeded to tell me that the cake would be too tart and so she said she would mix the raspberry with Italian buttercream.  I trusted her because she's the expert and I figured she'd make the cake taste even better than before! \n\nI went to pick up the cake and while I figured I would get a simple cake with awesome flavor, she gave me a cake that was significantly taller than I expected with a design that looked like a 6 year old did it.  I was disappointed but I only really cared about flavor.  \n\nMy husband was thrilled at the thoughtfulness and I think because of that, he didn't make a big deal about the flavor of the cake.  Once we cut into it, it was a dry supposedly lemon flavored cake (did not taste like lemon at all) and had 3 layers of a raspberry buttercream mix that had very little flavor but a lingering aftertaste.  \n\nI could not believe how disappointed I was in the price of the cake in comparison to what I took home.  I'm not one to complain even though my hubby has urged me to return the cake, I figured anyone who is looking to use this bakery should know about my experience.  I do not recommend it.","date":"2014-06-22 13:34:25","vector":[0.1188428571,0.4767,0.0,0.3172,0.0]}

I've been going to Sweetie's almost on a weekly basis ever since they opened, and everything there is amazing! It's all from scratch, including the frostings and ganache, and you can tell it's high quality ingredients. \n\nMy favorite are the ganache brownies and chocolate cake. Because they refrigerate the cakes, I normally let the slices warm up or microwave them for a few seconds. They taste better to me that way. And I always heat the brownies up a little. They're to die for, the best brownies I've ever had, bar none. \n\nIs this a real French bakery? No. If you go thinking it is, you'll be disappointed. And honestly, I've been to authentic French bakeries and, while their pastries were good, their cakes never had much flavor and were dry.  This is the exact opposite. I even ordered my birthday cake here. I did a Black Forest cake with ganache topping instead of frosting, and the filling was italian buttercream and chopped up cherries. Not a traditional Black Forest, but the expectations I had were spot on, and the cake was one of the best I've ever had. My friends raved about it. As far as cake designs go, the owner has told me they're still looking for someone who can do that, so I wasn't worried about how the cake looked, and I didn't ask for anything fancy, I just wanted \"Happy Birthday ________\" on it, and that's what I got. \n\nI've also tried their homemade chocolates, and they're very good too. I'm normally a Godiva girl since I used to work for the company, but I like the taste of the chocolate Sweeties uses better. I tried their flan and, while it was good, it was just as good as other places I'd tried. I've tried the chocolate croissant and the regular croissant too. I didn't care for the chocolate one, but the regular ones are amazing, I don't eat Publix ones anymore. \n\nDon't be deterred by the other reviews, if you want something sweet, this is the bakery to go to.","date":"2014-07-13 20:27:30","vector":[0.2055866667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

And I'm so glad that the weather co-operated, otherwise I would have missed out on one of my favourite festivals in the city!\n\nIt's essentially a slightly overpriced multicultural buffet in a park setting filled with music and a shopping bazaar -- ethnic trinkets and fashion can be bought, and even fortune telling can be had! But, as a festival, I expect to overpay a bit in order to sample food stuffs around the world and watch super cute children do their dances in costume.\n\nI ALWAYS go to the Croatian Pavillon year after year because they serve a mean roast pork and lamb, along with a small salad and bun. They also have the classic elephant ear as well, so it's pretty convenient that my fave eats in the festival is in one place. After that, it's \"anything goes\" -- whatever stall hits my fancy and whatever meat-on-a-stick is on sale, I probably get. While many stalls sell the same thing, not all spring rolls, donairs, or other similar offerings are alike. Different cultures DO spice and serve them differently, so if you're aching for gyros\/donairs, try say, the Iraq Pavillon instead of the more common Greek or Turkish one.\n\nAs a woman of Filipino heritage, I can't help but rep the Filipino stall and suggest the \"lumpia shanghai\" or spring roll (it's a lot meatier than other stalls), as well as the \"turon\" (basically a banana spring roll), and the \"gulaman drink\" -- which is a sweet drink with jello-like pieces. On behalf of my husband, who's Polish, he wants to point out that his culture sells non alcoholic Lech -- Polish beer.\n\nAnyway, if you're in Edmonton during the August long weekend, make sure to check out the Heritage Festival and see how different and alike we all are.","date":"2011-08-01 15:48:35","vector":[0.03402,0.0,0.0,-0.0674333333,0.0]}

Except for the eel roll, these are all very tame rolls and are not easy to mess up. The california was not bad and not anything special at the same time. The tempura roll was extrememly flavorless and the eel roll was just nasty. I am a big fan of eel, but this roll had a bad flavor and the eel was full of bones.

We went for lunch. \n\nIf people had been speaking el Rioplatense, which is the dialect spoken in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I would have thought I was in Buenos Aires instead of Maplewood, Missouri. \n\nI ordered a margarita pizza which was a 12 inch pizza that the two of us split. We ordered small side salads to go with it. Our server brought us the salads first; they were small salads with a little balsamic vinaigrette. I thought that my salad was good, but I didn't like the balsamic vinaigrette. I have made better balsamic vinaigrette at home. We were given water because both of us don't drink alcohol. The pizza was brought to us rather quickly because my friend was not finished eating his salad, but I had. Our pizza was not a thick crust pizza nor was it a thin crust pizza. It had thick crust on the edges but did not rise where the toppings were. Our server said the cook went to Italy to learn how to make the pizzas, but our pizza reminded me of the pizzas in many of the pizzarias in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It wasn't perfectly round like so many other places have, but shaped rustically, meaning not a perfect circle. The pizza did not have a crunchy crust either but was more bread like--overall, very good.\n\nWe were in a hurry so we didn't stay long, just long enough to eat and talk. They were not crowded at all so that kinda surprised me. I thought that they would be more busy than they were. \n\nI'm definitely going back.","date":"2014-08-28 01:55:35","vector":[0.11390625,0.123475,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

We got sat promptly at our reservation time in the corner of the restaurant opposite the bar and kitchen. It probably took 5-7 minutes for the male server to greet us at the table. We ordered a round of drinks (beer\/wine). My wife is pregnant, and when I asked our server if the bartender can make a non-alcoholic drink for her, he stated that he was 'not going to bother the bartender with the request because he was too busy'. Immediately, that rubbed us the wrong way. My wife then asked for a water and lemon instead, and he rudely answered, 'the water's in front of you'. We're still waiting for the lemon, sir...After we got our drinks, we put in two appetizers, salads, and our pizza orders. Appetizers came and were pretty good. About twenty minutes later, we got both our salads and entrees at the same time. I'm not sure if that was a back of the house mistake. However, our server didn't acknowledge it at all. The inconvenience was maneuvering around all of plates on the table. In fact once we got our food, he didn't return to the table, despite us attempting to wave him down for another round of drinks. And the servers' registers were in the corner next to us. So he was going back and forth between his other tables and the machine and didn't acknowledge us. \n\nWhen he did come to the table, he had the check split out. He didn't ask if we wanted another drink and did not ask if we wanted dessert, which we did want. At that point we were ready to leave the restaurant due to our bad experience. So we paid our bill, and walked down the street to Water St. Caf\u00e9, where we had more drinks and desserts (~$100 additional). We would have gladly spent our money at APS. At this point, we're not sure that we would come back.","date":"2015-05-27 16:38:24","vector":[-0.0411583333,-0.00545,0.17,-0.0292833333,0.0]}

Natty's makes three kinds of pizza: St. Louis, Chicago, and New York style (I got to meet the owner, Brian Williams, who has lived in and worked at pizza joints in all three cities, so he knows his pizzas.) I got a slice of the NY style mushroom and some stuffed garlic knots. My slice was huge and foldable. The mozzarella was salty and generous and the mushrooms were fresh and delicious. And the garlic knots? Stuffed with fontina and prosciutto. Holy Christ. This is some pretty tasty food. And there's one pizza on the menu that I'm headed back for: the South Sider with EVO, figs, goat cheese, and prosciutto. Sounds amazing.\n\nI was told there are still kinks to be worked out...getting a liquor license, oven issues. Give this upstart some time.

I ordered pepperoni, and there was so much pepperoni (we're talking 8 slices in a layer - i counted) that I woke up three times in the middle of the night dying of thirst. The salt level was excruciating! Don't get me wrong, too many ingredients is better than too few, but with salty pepperoni, no. There was also hardly any sauce on it whatsoever. There was a tiny thin layer at the top and idk if that's standard, but if you are going to give me two inches of crust, a ton of cheese, and a mound of pepperoni, sauce is a MUST to balance it out. I will definitely go back to try the other styles, maybe my mistake was ordering Chicago pizza from a St. Louis establishment.","date":"2010-12-20 17:32:57","vector":[0.0598181818,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.34]}

I love the sauce and the crust, and even though I don't usually order just cheese anywhere, but I think I will next time I go. The sauce and crust is that good.\nThe chicago style is different than what I thought of as a chicago deep dish pie. The crust is like cornbread... weird but delicious. The sauce was really good too, and chunky, I love it.\nThe Saint Louis style was okay, a little disappointing to a guy who grew up eating Imo's. But my past experience with every othe STL pretender has been even worse. I would give it a 7 out of 10 with Imo's being a 9 (nobody gets a 10) and other places being 5 or worse.\nI have one theory involving oven temperature... different styles of pizza have to be cooked at different temperatures. NY should be cooked hot and fast (maybe 800 deg) everything else at a lower temp, especially the Chicago since it has to cook longer. The high temp dries out the crust faster, making it hard and crumbly. This also applys to reheating NY slices. High temp burns up the crust before the toppings get hot.\nTo recap... love the New York style, Chicago second but probably won't get the STL again.","date":"2010-08-30 18:37:48","vector":[0.1706,0.0,0.0,0.06818,0.0]}

I was impressed by the flavor of both the pho ga and the egg rolls, especially since this is in a mall.  There was plenty of chicken in the pho and despite the lack of basil, nuoc mam, and real sarachi sauce, this was good stuff.  Also sampled the grilled pork and it too was excellent.  I'm not a fan of malls but \"What the Pho\" is good enough to endure mall traffic.  I would like to see them use real sarachi in take-a-way cups instead of the packets (just an odd flavor when preserved) and offer fresh basil leaves, but the flavor of the broth easily carries on without these.  The rolls were fresh, great texture, excellent flavor, and not greasy. (this is a BIG deal!)  Easily better than many of the other local pho shops just on quality alone and if they were in a normal restaurant setting with all the normal accoutrements for pho, this would  probably be the best place in northern Nevada.  They could teach some of the more recently opened local shops a thing or two about flavor!","date":"2013-12-18 00:20:18","vector":[0.4527636364,0.0,0.0,0.31845,0.0]}

It's hit or miss. The atmosphere is more on the trendy side. The female patrons are mostly \"enhanced\" in some sort of fashion. Although I don't think there is a strict dress code, it's more of a \"dress to impress\" type of place.\n\nThat being said, again some nights no one is there. Other nights, you can barely walk through the crowd and get to the bar. It typically takes 5-10 minutes just to get the attention of a bartender, and when you do, it's so loud in there you have to scream at them. When you do get their attention, they're very friendly. It's just a matter of them being understaffed.\n\nOn NYE I tried the food for the first time. It was part of the package when I bought my ticket to the event. It was so-so. I'll admit I had the drunk munchies, too! Otherwise, the food and drinks are waayyyy overpriced. I was also disappointed that they didn't have my cake flavored Vodka, which is really popular. Mangroves isn't my first choice of places to hit up in south Tampa, but it's okay for special occasions.","date":"2012-01-09 07:40:16","vector":[0.080575,-0.2775,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

However, when the valet solicited me for $10 instead of the $5 to put my car up front, I was a bit taken aback.

Our VIP waitress had some issues with some juvenile females who were sitting in our roped off VIP section as we arrived that were not part of our party.  She handled it well and was able to relocate these young ladies fairly quickly.  \n\nThe downstairs bar area or the outdoor area is a good place to be if you want to enjoy the atmosphere and stay out of the crowd.

I'm not sure what was in it, but it was really good.\n\nI also got the pan-seared Hudson Valley foie gras.  It was served with french toast, toasted pine nuts and poached pears... and that was all on top of some fig glaze.

They had a cool outdoor patio that might have been fun if it hadn't been 10000 degrees.

I thought it was a one off. We went there on a Friday night. Atmosphere was fairly typical for a bar\/pub. Slightly dingy, low lighting, etc. However, they did have a live entertainer at the piano who was super delightful and that helped with the atmosphere a lot. He took requests and did everything from Green Day to Buddy Holly to Eminem. Really great. Decent beer and drink menu. I took the beer special which was okay. Food menu was nothing special, just the typical pub\/burgers\/appies. I chose the Butter Chicken and my husband had the 2 piece fish and chips. My husband was really disappointed with his fish and chips. The fish pieces were super small for the price and they tasted okay but again nothing special. And just a couple of handfuls of frozen fries. However  I was bowled over with my butter chicken. The sauce was AMAZING. Probably the best I have had in along time. Served with saffron rice and naan bread with a dipping sauce, my dish was the clear winner. I couldn't believe that this place served such good butter chicken. Would definitely go here for that again. Apparently they make their own sauce. Otherwise, not too sure what to say about this place. I would suggest if you want live entertainment in a central location with some drinks, give this a whirl. It definitely isn't super trendy; so as a 40 something year old who is tired of the loud bar scene, I enjoyed it. If you love butter chicken, give this a whirl. Otherwise I would skip this and go to other places instead.","date":"2018-09-27 21:19:39","vector":[0.1205272727,0.0,0.7003,0.2143,0.0]}

I was there for lunch a few days ago and had their baby back ribs with onion rings, sweet potato fries, baked beans, and the mac and cheese fried puff things.  \n\nI have to say I'm spoiled when it comes to BBQ and I have a bias towards wet and oven baked BBQ. Killer B's features dry rub style ribs, which aren't my favorite style, but not bad. While the meat doesn't fall off the bone the way I like it, you do get a pretty good portion of meat on the ribs and it's a-okay for dry rub ribs. When I eat dry rub ribs, I have to pack on the sauce to make up for the fact that they don't fall off the bone. I think Killer Bs has room for improvement on their sauces. I thought the habanero sauce was a far cry from spicy (I love me some spicy food) and the house sauce was so so. I just thought all of the sauces were a bit too \nsweet for my taste.\n\nMy favorite side was the onion rings - they are fried to just the right level of crispiness. Sweet potato fries weren't bad either. I liked that the beans had chunks of meat in it, but I like my beans a bit softer. The mac and cheese puff appetizer was a unique surprise that I enjoyed (you get 6 of them, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it's filling) especially since they were fried just perfectly.\n\nAs far as atmosphere, I feel like the restaurant is just a bit confused. It's a BBQ joint, but it feels like they're trying to turn it into a sports bar? It doesn't help that the location is really narrow so it's difficult to really comfortable there. Anyway, the food is good and I'll be back to try the sandwiches - they looked great. I hope Killer B's sticks around and that their official launch goes spectacularly. I'd like to have a BBQ restaurant besides Woody's to go to.","date":"2011-02-18 06:20:07","vector":[0.184888,0.0,0.0,0.3612,0.6369]}

Our drinks were tasty and perfectly balanced. Which to me means excellent mixologists that taste their drinks before going out. And when the server found out that it was our anniversary, he asked us to enjoy our drinks and zipped off to the kitchen saying that one of the chefs had prepped us something 'a bit extra special'. The   chef Aly brought us out a dessert platter to DIE FOR! A selection of off menu sweet treats with a palate cleansing green apple jelly square and \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate! I can't recommend this place enough. We will for sure be going back for more meals, desserts, and after work drinks.

He's always had an adventurous spirit that materializes in his dishes. You never really know what to expect, because he isn't afraid to try something new! For this reason I was excited to hear about the new restaurant he co-owns called Revel.\n\nI've been here a few times already and they haven't even officially opened yet! They've just had soft launches and are trying things out. Already I've tasted quite a few promising dishes! I don't usually like fish but Chef Tony has a cod dish to die for. It's been a couple of weeks and I'm still thinking of it! I tried a perfectly braised brisket with fried onions, that was a sure winner for a meat lover like me. I'm not sure what will make the menu's final cut, but I've enjoyed most of what I've tasted. I'm sure the menu will evolve in keeping with Chef Tony's ongoing desire to change things up!\n\nI've been to this particular location in the past and Revel has kept a lot of the original design. They even have huge 100 year old urinals in the men's washroom! Don't ask how I know that hehe. There are beautiful decorative moldings on the ceilings in the bar area and gorgeous tiles on the walls. The tables in the bar area are even made from reclaimed wood from freight trailers that travelled millions of miles across North America! This new restaurant looks and feels high end but it's also trying to stay down to earth and relatable at the same time.\n\nThe dining area is large and spacious. Unfortunately, they can't control the fact that there is a space next door that gets rented out for parties. For this reason, loud music filters through that may not fit the restaurant's classy ambience. Sometimes you can't always help who your neighbors are. \n\nI also noticed that many of the servers didn't know all the details of the meals they were serving. Quality of service definitely impacts an overall food experience. For the most part, I've had friendly servers here. The main feedback I have is for the servers to somehow get a better understanding of the dishes they are serving. The servers are the first people we ask when we have questions about the food. I think this knowledge deficit should improve as the menu and servers get more established.\n\nThe management is open to feedback and are still working on tweaking things to improve the experience for their guests. I will be back and I totally recommend giving this place a chance. This new restaurant definitely has the potential to be a shiny new star on Jasper Avenue!","date":"2017-11-05 15:22:22","vector":[0.3542571429,0.0516,0.0,0.24933,0.0]}

The menu board is above your head at the counter, so you have to know in advance what you want or take a step back, and it's handwritten which makes it real old school.  Our order was a pulled pork plate and a whiskey chicken plate.  There were no biscuits ready, so we got cornbread with the plates, and it is some awesomely good cornbread, kudos there.  As for the pulled pork it was the best around honestly, tender, moist, and smoked just enough.  There are two sauce options available, whiskey and sweet.  The whiskey is solid and flavorful, and the sweet, well it is too sweet, but I myself had no issue with that. Now the whiskey chicken per my girlfriend was too soft and would have preferred being able to control how much sauce was on it.  I recommend losing the sauce as the default and cut up the chicken into nice slices instead of jigsaw pieces that are doused heavily in sauce.  Also quirky was we ordered bottled soda for dining in and the sodas were brought over with the pry caps still on.  Luckily had a bottle opener on the keychain, so just solved the issue myself.  They are expanding the building in the coming months, which will help a lot.  There is no public restroom for their small space currently.  I recommend getting the pulled pork as a carry out for the present time.  Oh and for sides, I vouch that the \"Pure Fries\" are good old fresh fries.  The coleslaw was decent, just nothing to rave about. With all this said, I can't wait to go back and try out the other offerings available.","date":"2016-03-22 17:31:07","vector":[0.2391285714,0.0,0.0,0.20095,0.0]}

Someone like this is bad for business (and Philly) and I can't be a patron at a place that I can't trust to not tamper with my food depending on your mood or attitude and therefore will not be returning. \n\nWhat a shame because with all the competition out there, you'd think you want customers back but it's not worth the trip back due to your unprofessional, immature workers that have a lot of growing up to do.","date":"2016-09-18 18:45:13","vector":[0.0023857143,0.148,0.0,0.0,0.0]}

It takes a while to get there but the woman at the register was super friendly, joking around and helping those who might be having a hard time making a decision. One of the cooks made me some extra onion when I brouggt it to their attention that the onion was missing from my order.\n\nConsidering the tight quarters the place seemed very clean although I did not visit the bathroom so can't say anything about that.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed mu visit,  thank you Sonny!","date":"2014-04-19 09:52:30","vector":[0.1178142857,0.7964,0.0,0.20095,0.0]}

His Goatness rides his bike to work past these folks while they're smoking, and he's been drooling to taste their BBQ for ages... was totally worth the wait. \n\nWe got the pulled pork mac'n'cheese, which was gooey, creamy, tasty, and had a hefty helping of perfect smoked meaty chunks covering the top. We also got the pulled pork sandwiches -- again, they did not skimp on the meat. They have their own BBQ sauces -- both the Memphis Sweet and the Carolina Gold were delicious (I wasn't up to trying their habanero tonight). But don't overuse the sauce!
